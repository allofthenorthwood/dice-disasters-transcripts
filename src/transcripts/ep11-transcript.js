export default `Oliver:
You're standing in a small clearing in the wild forest known as The Growth outside the city of Fell’s Keep. You're out here with Tallulah, the maroon Tiefling who owns a hostel in town. This morning, one of the Daughters of the Twin Moons named Jack, approached the  party, asking for help. Her colleagues, Charlie and Ash, were out in The Growth, searching for something called the Gray Flowers, which Jack claims will cure a sick family in the city. Jack became worried when Charlie and Ashton didn't return from their quest and you offered to go find them with Tallulah leading the way. After easily fighting off a few small electric spiders, you found Charlie, the large Elf with a booming voice and Ash, the sullen Half-Orc caught in a giant glowing web. As you tried to cut them down, three enormous Arachnovolts descended on your party. These monstrosities proved more difficult to kill and most of you took some pretty hard hits. Around you are the decimated bodies of the giant spiders. Max has his long sword lodged in the largest spider’s head, Zan is standing next to him, her hair full of flowers from Jasmin's healing spell, Erica has skewered the last spider that was insistent on going after Cody, who is still laying on the ground, wrapped up in electric spider web. Daughter Charlie and Daughter Ash are also still trapped in nets of webbing and appear to be unconscious or at least very out of it. What do you do? 
=== INTRO THEME: “Elysia” by People Need Goals ===
Allison:
Erica rustles through her backpack and pulls out her cell phone and her phone charger.
Oliver: Uh-huh? 
Allison: And is going to plug it into the web that is surrounding Cody. 
Oliver:
Great, great. Yeah, you plug one end of the cable into your phone and jam the other into the webbing that is glowing blue with electricity. Make a dexterity saving throw. 
Allison:
Dexterity, huh? [Dice Rolls] That's a 12. 
Oliver:
Okay, yeah. You feel a jolt of electricity and drop your phone and watch as it kind of likes sparks and, like, shit, like, starts popping off of it like the buttons pop out the side and the screen cracks. And your phone looks very bad, but you are not hurt. 
Robot:
Oh, no.
Allison:
Well, I guess that's what I get.
Talia:
God, I hate that. We're gonna have to go to the apple store to replace that.
Allison:
Okay. Erica puts that away, and, uh, pulls out her dagger and I would like to try to cut Cody free. 
Jasmin:
Can I help with that?
Cody:
Yes, please!


Alice:
I don't have a knife. I thought, I assumed I had a knife, but I don't have a knife. I'll just help
Oliver:
Jasmin hovers over you.
Alice:
In a concerned manner. 
Oliver:
Jasmin hovers over Erica as she cuts Cody out of the webbing. Yeah, Cody year now free. Your whole body feels really tingly and weird though, like your arms and legs fell asleep and are now regaining sensation.
Alan:
Cody just starts shaking his legs. Actually all of his limbs. He's kind of flopping around trying like
Cody:
I feel weird, this feels weird!
Talia:
Zan is gonna catch her breath and scratch absently at the flowers in her hair and walk back over to where she was helping Tallulah to cut down Charlie and Ash before. Just be like-
Zan:
Back to this, I guess. Hope there are no more spiders.
Oliver:
Charlie's head kind of lulls to the side. They've already been cut down, Ash is still dangling from the web. But they look unconscious, and Charlie's like,
Charlie:
Oh, thanks, Dad.
Zan:
No problem, son.
Oliver:
Yeah. You cut both of them free of all of the webbing. And they look pretty out of it and Tallulah just scratches their head. 
Tallulah:
Um, do ah, any of you have any heals left? I think I saw you doing some of those earlier.
Zan:
Yeah, I can do one heal, but.
Max:
I can. 
Erica:
Yeah, I can, too. 
Zan:
Rock, paper, scissors.
Cody:
Not to be selfish, but I could use some. 
Zan:
All right, great. I don't feel too good. Jasmin, you're already over by Cody. So, Max, I'll take these two, and uh, Zan walks over and casts cure wounds on Ash, whatever, random, with my shiny new spell slot. 
Oliver:
Awesome! 
Talia:
So that is 1d8 with my ability modifier. That's a six plus two. So that's eight hit points. 
Oliver:-
Yeah, you watch as this pink and yellow energy flows out of Zan and into this Half-Orc woman who's wearing one of the all black uniforms of the Daughters of the Twin Moons and her eyes jolt open and she's like, 
Ash:
Uh, uh, get off. Stop! What are you doing? Just-
Oliver:
And she, like, tries to sit up, but her arms are like all floppy and she just kind of, like, rolls over onto her side. It's like,
Ash:
Uh, what happened? 
Zan:
Spiders.
Ash:
Oh, right. 
Zan:
Electric spiders. 
Ash:
Okay, the electric spiders. Just give me a minute.
Zan:
Yep.
Ash:
Oh.
Talia:
Zan finishes casting the spell, and I just sort of pats her on the head and walks away. 
Ash:
No, don't, I hate- Ugh. Stop it! 
Zan:
Alright. Cool, alright.
Oliver:
Zan leaves.
Robot:
Uh, are they under any sort of poison or disease, or is it just there a little loopy? 
Oliver:
You don't know.
Alice:
I think they're just under some zappy zaps.
Robot:
Okay, I will.
Oliver:
You could roll a medicine check to find out. 
Robot:
Nah, I just dump five points of my Lay Hands into the other Daughter. 
Oliver:
Yeah. Alright. That pink and yellow energy flows off of Max into this pretty big Elf person, and Charlie also jolts awake.
Charlie:
Whoa! Oh, oh. All right. I feel much better! Oh, wait, nope. Can't move my arms or my legs. 
Zan:
Feel a tiny bit better. 
Charlie:
Feel a tiny bit better. Hello there. Nice to meet you. 
Oliver:
And they kind of, like, flop one arm over and are like,
Charlie:
I'm holding out my hand for you to shake it.
Oliver:
They're not holding it out. 
Robot:
I'll pick up their hand from their side and just shake it. 
Charlie:
Ah, yes. Very nice to meet you. Thank you for rescuing us from the clutches of these wild beasts. I'm about ready to continue on the, on the adventure.
Oliver:
They kind of like flop their arms back over the other side
Charlie:
In a minute. If you just give me a minute.
Zan:
Yeah, I'll start the timer.
Charlie:
All right, any second now, 
Zan:
Like 30 more seconds. 
Oliver:
Tallulah has been kind of just like walking around the clearing like looking out into the growth. And she makes her way back over and stands over Ash, who is still laying in the grass like panting, trying to move her arms. And you see, that Ash has this, like big black robe over top of her Daughter's uniform and around her neck, there's just, like must be like 20 necklaces with different pendants of different shapes and sizes, and Tallulah stands over her and says, 
Tallulah:
Give me your warding charm.
Oliver:
And Ash like looks up at her and it's like,
Ash:
Ha! Fat chance, eat shit.
Oliver:
And you watch as Tallulah just kind of, like, leans her head back and sighs and then kicks Ash in the side and then reaches down and starts rummaging through her robes. Then she pulls out a corded necklace with a metal charm dangling from it and Ash this whole time is like feebly trying to stop her. But she's still, like, kind of fucked up from the webbing. So she's mostly just shouting. And she's like,
Ash:
Fucking bitch! Get up, look up! Give it back! Stop it! Stop!
Oliver:
And Tallulah is like holding this charm now and she looks at your party and says, 
Tallulah:
Can you all gather up next to Charlie and Ash?
Erica:
In a moment, we need to take care of Cody still.
Tallulah:
Okay.
Alice:
Um, I think during this Jasmin was, like, wiping some hair out of Cody's eyes and doing like the back of the hand check on his forehead to make sure that he doesn't have a fever from the zaps. Um.
Cody:
Hey, Jasmin. Hey. I mean, I'm not fine, but I'm ish. I'm OK. It's OK. Don't worry.
Jasmin:
I'm just, I'm just making sure. Here. Hold on. And she's going to use one of the D6 of Balm of the Summer Court to heal him. That is a four. So you get four hit points.
Cody:
Oh, thank Thank you. It feels good.
Zan:
Boy, you look silly. Look at all those flowers in your hair.
Oliver:
Yeah, indeed. Cody does have a bunch of flowers. 
Cody:
What?
Alan:
Cody put his hands to his head.
Cody:
Oh, oh! What color are they? I can’t see!
Alan:
He keeps looking up trying to see his own head.
Cody:
What color are they?
Oliver:
Jasmin?
Um, I think they're like those ones that are, like, pinkish on the outside. But then they're like orange in the middle and this kind of like green.
Talia:
Ooooh. Lovely.
Cody:
That sounds really cool. Remind me to find a mirror. 
Jasmin:
It must look pretty nice. 
Cody:
Okay, what’re we talking about?
Erica:
Um, Tallulah wants us together. Hold on. I'll help you up.
Cody:
Okay, thank you!
Oliver:
Yeah, Cody, you're not paralyzed or anything. Ah, you just feel kind of tingly. And also bad from the many spider bites you took. 
Alan:
He saunters over weakly to the group. But getting more pep in his step as he, uh, as he walks.
Alice:
I think as Jasmin walks along Cody, uh, she looks at Tallulah and remembers that Tallulah took a pretty big bite too and then just like cast the last D6 on Tallulah.
Oliver:
Okay, great.
Alice:
That would be a four.
Oliver:
Do you tell her you're doing this or do some flowers show up in her hair?
Alice:
No, I don’t tell her I’m doing this. No.
Oliver:
Okay. She now has some flowers in her hair too. She looks a little a little hartier. Once you're all together Tallulah walks around all of you in a circle, dangling the charm like a pendulum. And when she makes it all the way around a translucent purple bubble has formed over all of you.
Tallulah:
There, we’ll be safe in here and can rest for a bit.
Oliver:
And she walks over to where Ash is laying and drops the necklace on her then turns to the rest of you.
Tallulah:
You can leave and come back if you want, but don't go too far.
Oliver:
Jasmin, she hands you a bag that she brought with her and says,
Tallulah:
There's food and some alves in there. Help yourself.
Oliver:
Tallulah picks up her battleaxe, walks through the wall of the bubble and over to the other side of the clearing, and then she sits down on a fallen log with her back to you.
Jasmin:
Uh, are you, aren't you, aren't you staying here with us?
Tallulah:
I'll keep watch. Rest up.
Oliver:
Okay. You can all take a short rest now if you want. 
Talia:
God, I don't know how to take a short rest.
Allison:
Erica opens up her menu and hits Song of Rest and says, 
Erica:
Everybody, good job of fighting the spiders. Everybody, let's all take a nap. 
Alice:
Nice.
Allison:
And everyone gains three hit points. 
Oliver:
Oh, okay. Question. Did you bring all of your stuff with you?
Allison:
Sure did.
Alice:
I think so? We didn't have, we don't have much stuff. 
Allison:
Yeah.
Robot:
I mean, we don't have anything. Everything we own is in bags that we have on us, so.
Oliver:
Okay, Great. Yeah, I was just wondering, you could have left your bag there. Yeah, from Jasmin's shoulder bag. You hear a faint noise? That sounds kind of like 
Talia:
I fucking hate that noise.
Cody:
Not this again.
Zan:
You pick up. 
Alan:
I open up my bag.
Oliver:
And yeah in your bag, you have that black metal backup box that CASTR gave you two or three days ago. I believe you all are on day five of your adventure. 
Allison:
Wow. 
Oliver:
And the boxes in there and there is a little blue light that is flashing.
Allice:
Uh, Justin is going to take out the box and like, hold it up and just say, 
Jasmih:
Uh, hello? CASTR?
Oliver:
Cool.
Cody:
Did it wake up?
Max:
I didn't know it was alive. 
Jasmin:
I don't know?
Allison:
Can I do an investigation on the box to see if I can find any, like, buttons or anything. 
Oliver:
Yeah. Go for it. 
Allison:
Oh, no, I got six.
Alice:
Can I help?
Alan:
I'm holding it. 
Oliver.
Sure,Yeah.
Allison:
Yeah. It's a 10. It's, uh yeah. 
Oliver:
So, Erica, you come over and kind of like, take this box from Jasmin and as you do try to hand it off. You, like, fumble it totally and almost drop it. But then you catch it, and you have clamped your hand down right over where the light is, and you hear a probably not nostalgic but familiar voice that says
CASTR:
Local messaging system established two new messages.
Zan:
The fuck?  I thought that was like a USB drive, not a cellphone.
Allison:
We've gotta CASTR pager here.
Max:
Did someone leave us voicemails?
Cody:
What's a pager? 
Zan:
Like a shitty cell phone. Don't worry about it.
Allison:
Okay. I want to try to play the message. If I can press that button, er that light again. 
Oliver: Yeah, It's like a smooth metal surface, but when you tap on the light again. You hear the voice continue and it says 
CASTR:
Message one. Congratulations. You are now level two. You're SPEL Proprietary wrist bands have been updated to reflect your increased compatibility with sympathetic parallel energy.
Allison:
Okay, I'm gonna press it again.
Oliver: Okay. And you pressed again, and it says
CASTR:
Message two. Congratulations! You are now level three. Your SPEL proprietary wristbands have been updated to reflect your increased compatibility with sympathetic parallel energy.
Allison:
Neat. 
Talia:
You press it one more time, and it says we're cleaning carpets in your area. Are you a homeowner in need? 
Allison:
Your Paypal has been activated.
Talia:
Hi. I'm with Bank of America, and we're calling to tell you that your credit card may have some errors.
Oliver:
All right, After you go through those three messages, the light is no longer blinking. And you just have a black box again. 
Zan:
Great.
Cody:
We make calls with it? You said it was like a bad cell phone. Like, can we use it?
Talia:
I don't think so. 
Allison:
Does anything happen if I hold the light? 
Oliver:
Yes. So Erica holds her finger down on where that light was. It's now off and you hear that familiar chime. And another message. 
CASTR:
Ding dong. Two way connection not yet established. 
Allison:
Hm.
Oliver:
And then if you do it again, you hear the same message.
Allison:
So it sounds like it can make outward calls. Probably just to other CASTRs or necessarily people that we don't want to talk to, but that we can't do that yet.
Alice:
 Well, um…
Allison:
Back in the bag! 
Alice:
Yeah. I mean, I guess that means that means we can't do anything else with it for now.
Oliver:
For now, the two of you look over and Charlie has fallen asleep. They are just like snoring gently. And Ash is looking at all of you. And she's kind of like she's still paralyzed. So her head's just kind of like flung to the side and her hair's like all over.
Ash:
And she's like, what the fuck was that? What is that? What is it? What do you have? What is it? What is that? 
Erica:
It's magic. You wouldn't understand. It's fine.
Ash:
Oh, fuck you. Oh, no, you did not-
Zan:
Why would you do that? You just like antagonize her. 
Alice:
I’ll put the box back inin my bag. 
Ash:
I specialize in the intersection of magic and objects. 
Erica:
Like, it's-
Cody:
It was given to us by who brought us here? 
Erica:
It’s like, a… I got nothing.
Zan:
It it really. It's very advanced. I'm surprised that you haven't heard of it, but it's just, it's just a way to tell us how we've grown as a party. 
Allison:
Can I do a persuasion?
Oliver:
You’re going to have to make a deception check. 
Allison:
Deception or persuasion, because I'm not lying?
Oliver:
Oh that's true. I guess it is pretty advanced. Okay, yeah make a persuasion check. 
Allison:
I got a six.
Oliver:
Okay, Ash just-
Allison:
Actually no, you know what, I'm going to use my point of inspiration on that.
Oliver:
Oh, hey, nice. Yeah. Do it!
Allison:
Mm hmm. That’s a seven. Goodbye inspiration.
Oliver:
You see Erica kind of flub an answer and then stand up a little straighter, look Ash in the eye and fucking flub her answer again. Ash just narrows her eyes at you and is like
Ash:
Once I can move. I want to look at the box. 
Erica:
It's our box.
Jasmin:
It's it's it's. It's in my bag. You can't look in my bag.
Erica:
I don't think you can make these demands. I mean, we just saved your life.
Ash:
Fine. Guess I'll just lay here like a slug stare at my own warding charm, which is keeping us safe. 
Oliver:
She kind of like rolls over grumpily. 
Zan:
Would you rather the warding charm was not keeping us safe? 
Ash:
Shut up.
Talia:
All right. Okay. I'm going to rummage through the food bag that Lulu left behind and then reach into my bag and pull out Hat, who’s definitely fine and happy and give her a little food.
Oliver:
Yeah. Hat gobbles up the little pieces of bread that you give her. She's, she's looking great. She's having a lot of fun.
Talia:
I spent some time playing with her.
Oliver:
Great.
Allison:
By the way. I should clarify a song of rest only works if you expend hit dice. So if you do want those extra three hit points, you're going to have to expend at least one hit dice to get it.
Talia:
Oh yeah. I was waiting so that we wouldn't interrupt the story that was happening.
Oliver:
Yes. Sorry, we got a little distracted, but go ahead, roll some hit dice.
Alice:
I'm rolling one. 
Talia:
I got a 10. I've maxed out.
Alice:
Yeah, me too. By the way, I should have mentioned this to Alan when I healed Cody. But Cody, you have one temporary hit point out and so does son.
Talia:
Oh, nice.
Oliver:
So your party spends an hour here safe within this little dome. But, yeah, you have an hour to just sit here and feel better.
Talia:
Zan is going to climb a tree and take a nap in the tree. 
Oliver:
Yeah. So, Zan, you wander out of the bubble as you pass through the translucent purple surface you don't feel anything other than like a slight shiver. And then once you're outside the bubble and look back at it, you see that it is opaque. So you can't see back into the bubble. Once you're outside, but you can go find a tree and climb it and just lounge there for a bit.
Talia:
Well, a bit of wish fulfillment for me. Talia, who wants to take a nap.
Oliver:
Okay, great. Yeah. You can just take off your head bones and lay down and.
Allison:
I want to ask Ash a question.
Erica:
So, Ash, did you guys find that flower yet?
Ash:
No, we haven't. Well, I can really move very well yet, but they're like little gray flowers. But the size of a silver piece. They also kind of run around. So I guess they're going to have to hunt for those, too, once we're done.
Allison:
Erica, just like kind of smiles and nods, like, okay. 
Oliver:
She's like, 
Ash:
I brought a jar for them. It's in my bag. I’ll get it once I can move my arms again. So where did you say you were from?
Allison:
Erica looks around everyone else to see if they have an answer for that.
Alice:
Blank stare.
Cody:
I'm from Missouri. 
Oliver:
Where the hell is Missouri?
Cody:
Uh, that way.
Alan:
And Cody just points in a direction.
Oliver:
Make a deception check. 
Alan:
Sure. Why not? I do not know. I'm telling the truth. So I would say deception is OK. 
Oliver:
Yeah.
Alan:
As a nine plus two, that’s eleven.
Oliver:
You have a plus on deception?
Alan:
My charisma’s plus three and I have a negative one from my trait.
Oliver:
Ash kind of is like,
Ash:
OK, sure. Great. 
Cody:
You know. 
Zan:
Where are you from?
Ash:
I'm from Fells Keep, the city that we were in just now.
Cody:
I've been there.
Ash:
Great. That makes sense since you're here from there. 
Zan:
Cody has a friend there. 
Ash.
Cool. I don't care. 
Zan:
Wow.
Alan:
He looks dejected by that one. 
Cody:
OK, sure. I was happy to have a friend, but OK, I guess we don't want friends or whatever.
Jasmin:
It's OK. Cody, some people don't know how to appreciate friends.
Ash:
I can appreciate friends. Fine. I just don't care if other people have friends. I don't see what's so wrong with that.
Alan:
Cody just kind of not looks away, but kind of just his body language shifts to where he’s is no longer there for the conversation and he just taps his wristbands together and kind of pulls up the menu to kind of just play with it. Because clearly this conversation is not for him. 
Oliver:
Great. Ash sees you do that and is like,
Ash:
What the fuck is that? Where did you get that?
Cody: 
Oh, it was a present. It was given to us. 
Ash:
Let me see it.
Cody:
OK.
Allison:
Right. But like Erika, just kind of like pauses Cody and is like.
Cody:
What? It's cool.
Ash:
Yeah, it is cool. Let me see it. Not wrong. Get closer. 
Allison:
Erica’s shoulders just drop and she lets Cody go. 
Alan:
Cody just runs over.
Cody:
It's like. It's like look look it moves with my hand wherever it goes.
Ash:
What the… Hold, hold still. What does it say?
Cody:
I have a really hard time holding still. It just it just says it has my name.
Ash:
What language is that?
Cody:
The one I'm speaking now. 
Ash:
No, it isn't. You're speaking common. And that is not common. I can read. Can you read?
Cody:
This has been a question as of late. I thought I could. Apparently I can’t. So. OK. Well, I can read this. I can read this. This is what I can read right here on my wrist.
Ash:
Mm hmm. Must be some sort of old rune. What does it do?
Cody:
Oh, it just it. Well, it tells me, like, how I'm doing. Like, right now I got 14 out of 14.
Ash:
Like a mood ring?
Erica:
Exactly. Exactly. 
Allison:
Erica says 
Cody:
Well, it says I'm healthy, so we're good. Just as good. Like it's like a Fitbit. Have you ever had a Fitbit? 
Ash:
No, what's a Fitbit? 
Cody:
It doesn't count steps. It just lets you know. It just keeps track of, like, how you’re doing? 
Ash:
OK. So, like, if you feel bad, it will tell you you feel bad. 
Cody:
I mean, I couldn't look at it a few minutes ago, but I have a feeling it would have told me.
Ash: 
Wow. That is utterly useless. OK. 
Erica:
Sure is, yep. Like we don't even know why we have these.
Oliver:
Great.
Alan:
Wouldn't they have seen us utilizing these to cast our spells?
Oliver:
Ash probably did in ash had like tied up in all of those like all of that webbing during that whole fight and wasn't doing so great until I think Zand came over and healed her.
Alan:
Gotcha. OK. I'm just curious. 
Oliver:
Yeah.
Alan: Tallulah might have noticed. 
Oliver: Yeah, Tallulah did. Definitely noticed. Like, you guys weren't like trying to hide it or anything. And she spent like many rounds of combat with you. So but Tallulah's off just sitting on a log.
TakuaL
Mood. Zann yells from a tree. 
Zann:
Apropos of nothing.
Alan:
Cody, after having shown the SBL off, excitedly walks back towards Jasmine and with his back turned and as quietly as it goes, 
Cody:
I just saw I have new spells.
Jamin:
What do you have, huh?
Cody:
I didn't really get the chance to look. I was talking but there. I'll show you later.
Jasmin:
Yeah. Yeah. We should probably take a look at that later. OK. You might explode some stuff when we do it. So it's I need some good clean space.
Alan:
Cody's eyes get really big and he gets a little bit, a little bit hesitant. Like good thought.
Robot:
OK, I’m going to take some time when it seems like the conversation has died down. Max is gonna walk over to Erica and just sit next to her.
Max:
Hey. 
Erica:
Hi, Max. Hey.
Max:
So this world has, like, magic. Right. We can all do magic. That's a thing. 
Erica:
Yeah. It seems like it.
Oliver:
Max has just realized.
Max:
So what if and stay with me here. What if, you know, I've ever read a comic book. You know, like superheroes.
Erica:
Yeah. Yeah, I'm familiar. 
Max:
I got bit by a spider. What if I can turn into Spider-Man?
Allison
Erica's eyes narrow and. And she's like, 
Erica:
Well, you don't have glasses, so we don't know if that's part of it.
Allison:
And her eyes narrowed more. And she's like, 
Erica:
You should maybe try to climb a tree and see if I could do a good job. That would be a good way of telling.
Max:
Yes. Yeah. OK. 
Robot:
Are there any trees in the bubble?
Oliver:
No. The bubbles only like maybe 10 or 15 feet in diameter.
Robot:
OK. 
Allison:
Did Erica, see which tree Zang climbed up into? 
Oliver:
Yeah.
Allison:
So Erica is going to point to that tree and say, 
Erica: Yeah, try to climb that one like as fast as you can. All right.
Robot:
Cool. All right. OK. Max is just going to run and try to get up that tree as fast as possible to make athletics check.
Robot:
That's a nat 20.
Oliver:
Max like turns effortlessly slide into like a sprinter's mark. And then just froom, he's across the clearing, runs plants a foot on the tree, grabs a branch, holds himself up there and is Max, you're just squatting on top of Zann.
Zann:
Why? 
Oliver:
Zann, you fall out of the tree.
Zann:
Why can't you just let me sleep Max?
Max:
Erica, look I’m Spider Man!
Allison:
Erica is completely surprised and is also standing up. And obviously, Max can't see her. Yeah, but it's just like,
Erica:
Holy shit, I think he’s Spiderman.
Robot:
Max is going to sit on the branch, concentrate really hard and try to shoot web.
Oliver:
Okay. Make a what check would this be?
Robot:
Don't know.
Alan:
How is this a check? Please explain to me how passing a check it's going to all of a sudden let Max shoot web out of his hands?
Allison:
I think that the check could affect whether like he shits his pants or something. Concentrating so hard, trying to expel something from his body.,
Oliver:
Let's see.
Talia:
Would shitting his pants be a success or like partial?
Alice:
It's like a horseshoe thing. A nat one would be shitting his pants and so would a natural 20. 
Oliver:
Make an insight check.
Robot:
That's a nat one. I am minimum over maximum today. 
Oliver:
You just like, clench every muscle in your body. Extend your hand and try to push out web from somewhere and you get a massive fart. A little bit of poop comes out.


=== Midroll Start ===




Alan:
Hello and welcome to Dice Disasters. This is the part of the show where we stop pretending to be other people and start pretending to be ourselves. Today, we got Alice, hello Alice.
Alice:
Hello!
Alan:
So wonderful to hear your voice.
Alice:
Thank you. So wonderful to hear yours.
Alan:
Well, hey, we hope you're enjoying this episode. It was really fun, one to kind of get some time to talk to these new characters and find out more about this world we find ourselves in.
Alice: 
I always love just I was going to say exposition time. But, like, it's a different thing, that exposition. Right? You get to ask stuff. They ask you things.  And it's just the interactions are always really nice. But there's just such a cool difference between being told something by a narrator and being told something by a character because you don't know if it's like true or if there's like implicit bias is involved. I love that sort of stuff.
Alan:
Yeah. I love the moments where, like when I'm having to talk to on their NPC, I feel like I'm more taking in the information as Cody than I am as Allen. And I like that that flow that you can get into. I hope everyone at home is enjoying it as much as we are experiencing it. But we want to stop by real quick and kind of make sure you knew where to find us on the Internet so you can talk to us, engage with us. And we because we want to hear from you.
Alice:
You can find us on Twitter at Dice Disasters. And our website is DiceDisasters.com. I think we occasionally use Instagram, but not very often. But in case you do use Instagram, then that would be nice. Dice dot disasters.
Alan:
Yeah. Whenever we have something visual to show people, we definitelym we do use our Instagram we are a podcast, so we don't always have visual stuff. But I know recently we took a screenshot of all of us while we were recording. Oh, video chat window of all of us. If you want to see our faces and what we look like, you can check us out there. I think we posted it on Instagram and Twitter. So either those places you can you can find them.
Alice:
Yeah, except mine this fake. Because because I am on the other side of the ocean. So it was really pixellated. So I had to Photoshop me in. 
Alan:
You weren’t supposed to tell people, Alice, giving away our secrets. 
Alice:
It's fine. Looks just like the real Alice. 
Alan:
Yes, absolutely. 100 percent real. Alice in the photo.
Alice:
Certified genuine.
Alan:
It's the best kind. And don't forget that if you review the show or share the show on social media, then we might include your name as an NPC’s name in the podcast. So please do that. 
Alice:
It also just helps us a lot. I think reviews are one of the biggest factors in how people find podcasts and there are so many podcasts out there, especially actual play podcasts. So if you do it. Not only do you get an NPC, maybe you also just help us out.
Alan:
Absolutely. And also, another way you can get involved is summit item ideas for our adventurers to have as we explore this world. So go to our Web site, Dicedisastrous.com, and you can submit your item idea directly to Oliver and they will take it from there. And someday you might see your idea pop up in our world.
Alice:
Yeah. I don't know how Allison managed it, but somehow that forum on the website is just a direct link to Oliver's brain.
Alan:
Yeah, I don't know. She is a whiz at our web design. So she's she works in mysterious ways. Well, but, Alice, if someone wanted to like see like your art and your stuff, where where could they find you on the Internet.
Alison:
If you want to find my art specifically, I have a portfolio Website on outstation Arstation it’s Artstation dot com slash Alice Jooren. My surname is spelled J, double O, ren since I know it's not exactly a common one and that's also my Twitter. My Twitter is also just Alice Jooren. So if you want to follow me on Twitter, you can do that as well. Even though I think I mostly post garbage.
Alan:
Oh, pfft, now you are amazing and I love like just seeing what you're up to. Actually, if you don't mind, I'd love to also mention your twitch gets news sporadically will stream you working on art, which is really fun to watch.
Alice:
Oh yeah I do. So my twitch is gay Alice.
Alan:
Perfect. On brand and on. Wonderful. There is nothing better than 100 percent authentic Alice. Love it. Well anyways. Well, thanks so much for stopping by the middle part of the episode. We'll let you get back to the fun stuff and joy. Thanks. Bye.


=== Midroll End ===


Zan:
You just fucking push me out of the tree so you could fart in it? Dude!
Max:
Uh, I'll be back. 
Robot:
Max is going to pop out of the tree and just run off. 
Zan:
Don’t hurry back. Jesus.
Alan:
Cody yells after her,
Cody:
That was a nice one!
Robot:
I just give him a thumbs up and a big smile as Max runs off.
Oliver:
He 100 percent can't see you because of the bubble, but-
Alan:
Absolutely.
Oliver:
Everyone else can.I heard all this yelling. Charlie has woken up and is like,
Charlie:
Oh, we're in a bubble.  All right, that seems good. Let me see if I can move my arms.
Oliver:
They kind of flap them over to one side.
Charlie:
No. Not yet.
Jasmin:
Good morning.
Charlie:
Good morning. I'm Charlie. They, them. This is my compatriot Ash. She, her. We are bothDaughters of the Twin Moons. How can we be of service? I mean, please don't ask me anything that involve moving my arms or my legs.
Jasmin:
No, you can be of service by resting, I guess?
Charlie:
Oh, good. I love that. And what are your names?
Jasmin:
I’m Jasmin. This is Cody. 
Cody:
Hi, I'm Cody. He, him.
Jasmin:
This is Erica.
Erica:
Hi. She, her.
Charlie:
Great. It is nice to meet all of you. I thought there were more of you before, but maybe that was just me seeing double.
Jasmin:
The, the big fart man that woke you up is Max.
Charlie:
Great. 
Erica:
And that little that little angry one over there. That's Zan. She, her.
Charlie:
Great. Perfect. Now that we are all acquainted. Hello.
Max:
Well, I have an important question. One that I've had for like a day now. 
Charlie:
Yes. 
Max:
Uh, whose daughter are you? 
Charlie:
Ah, yes! The Daughters of the Twin Moons. We are a borderless organization for good. We go anywhere and everywhere we're needed. We help people without expecting anything in return. And we freely teach others to protect themselves. Our tenants are relentless kindness and bravery. Anyone can be a daughter. Of course it is gender neutral.
Max:
Oh, that's cool.
Jasmin:
A relentless kindness and bravery. 
Charlie:
That's us!
Jasmin:
Are you sure Ash is one?
Erica:
Jasmin!
Oliver:
Ash is like glaring at you. And she says, 
Ash:
Excuse you. You don't know me. We just met.
Jasmin:
Sorry. You’re just kind of abrasive.
Allison:
Erica is immediately going to say,
Erica:
Hey, how about a song, everybody? 
Allison:
And Erica is going to do a performance. She's just going to start singing. So I'm going to roll the check first so that I know how to perform. [Rolls]  I am doing real bad rolls today. That's a 14.
Oliver:
All right. That's pretty good. 
Alice:
It's not that bad. 
Allison:
So, well, I mean, I have a plus five to performance now. Thank you very much. Level up.
Olliver:
Nice!
Allison:
Erica is just miming the WB frog dance and is just saying,
Erica:
Hello, my baby, hello my darling, hello my ragtime gal!.
Allison:
And I want to see if that distracts Ash and Charlie.
Oliver:
Charlie is like, 
Charlie:
Oh, my God, you're amazing. That, that's so funny. Did you write that? 
Erica:
Sure didn't, bud.
Allison:
And I'm continuing to just dance and kind of hum along with the tune. 
Charlie:
Wow. Oh, I would clap if I could. Actually, let me try.
Oliver:
And they like, swing both of their arms over to one side. That noise was me actually swinging my arms and my desk and kind of slapped them against their sides like a big happy seal. Slap, slap, slap. 
Talia:
1-800-Are-You-Slapping.
Oliver:
And Ash is like,
Ash:
Okay, okay. Yeah. Okay. Great song. Listen, being nice and being kind are two completely different things. Okay? Fuck tons of people are nice. They're polite and say soft words to de escalate conflict, but they haven't got a kind bone in their body. Everything they say doesn't do shit to actually help people. I help people. Just not nice about it, okay? 
Max:
You don't learn that lesson on Sesame Street.
Allison:
Erica's just humming louder and she wishes that she picked a song she knew all the words to.
Jasmin:
It's fine. I'm I'm sorry I didn't mean anything by it.
Charlie:
Well, I thought it was a. Great song and a great sense. I would love to learn it again once I can move my legs.
Max:
Well, don't be, don't be mad. We're just, we're new around here. And we don't know a lot of people. So, like, we don't know-- we can't tell the difference between nice and kind yet. Like, we just don't know anybody. And we just, we just want to be safe and know that who we’re around are good people.
Charlie:
Well, for that look no farther than the Daughters. I promise. We're actually, most of us are very nice. Don't pay attention to her. She's just cranky.
Jasmin:
Your organization does sound cool.
Charlie:
I like it a lot. Been a Daughter since I was, uh, let's see. Twelve. Twelve or so. It’s a good life. Good people.
Max:
Question. Does everybody who join get cool ropes? 
Charlie:
Depends. You can go for a robe look or a more sleek look like myself. They've got a more shirt and pants outfit. We try to have most of the Daughters wear recognizable uniform so people can find us if they need help. 
Oliver:
Let's check in on Max real quick. Max, make a survival check, see if you can find something to, like, wash off your body. 
Talia:
Make sure you don't die in the woods. 
Allison:
Max finds wet wipes.wet wipes.
Oliver:
What you get?
Robot:
Fifteen. 
Oliver: Okay, great. Yeah. You make your way back to that river that you passed earlier in the day and you clean yourself up and you can come back to the bubble now if you want.
Robot:
At the end of that conversation. Max comes back. All of his clothes are dry, but his hair is still soaking wet.
Oliver:
Great. Max slides into the bubble and sits down very nonchalantly.
Talia:
Outside the bubble, Zan goes up to Tallulah and says,
Zan:
So tell me all about the Daughters in detail. What kind of organization are they?
Oliver:
No you don’t! You can just hear what they're talking about in the bubble. You're not that far.
Talia:
Oh, okay. I wasn’t sure cause I can't see them. 
Oliver:
You can't see them. 
Talia:
I'm just listening. All right, cool.
Jasmin:
Do you want join the Daughters, Cody?
Cody:
I like the robes. I mean, why do people join?
Charlie:
Oh. Hmm. It's an interesting question. I suppose it's different for everyone. We take in a lot of kids who don't have anywhere else to go and by no means are they required to be a Daughter. That is a decision a person has to make for themselves. But a lot of them do. And we also take adults who wish to join. I mean, the benefits are wonderful. If you love helping people. That's all we do.
Cody:
Well, I am a kid, but I'm sticking with my friends here because we're working on going home. I don't want to leave them. I do have a place to go. I like helping people. But, I mean-
Max:
And Cody looks around at the group.
Cody:
We're good at it, but we're new at it. So do you all help people get better at helping people?
Charlie:
Oh, yes, definitely. We do all sorts of training and either self-defense or compassion training and exercises to just learn to make your community better and lots of things like that. Jack actually teaches. Oh, Daughter Jack is a teacher at Fell’s Keep.
Jasmin:
We met Jack.
Charlie:
Oh, she's delightful, isn't she?
Jasmin:
She sent us here actually to check on you. 
Charlie:
Oh, she did. Oh yes. I mean. Well, I had sensed all of you have very graciously risked your lives to save ours. I imagine she'll be handing out blessing to each of you when you get back, which is a pretty cool little ceremony, if I do say so myself.
Zan:
Sounds good.
Talia:
Zan says from outside of the bubble.
Max:
Cody looks over at Erika and then up at Jasmine and back to Erika and is like,
Cody:
I know we weren't here to join anything, so we don't have to if we need to get going. But like we could use with some help learning how to do this. Right?
Charlie:
Oh, you don't need to join the Daughters to do our training programs.
Cody:
Oh!
Charlie:
We offer those for free to anyone who needs them.
Allison:
Basically, Erica leans over to Max and just goes,
Erica:
Scientology.
Oliver:
We also offer a free personality test. 
Robot:
Oh, no.
Cody:
Oh, well, Okay, well, that's that's good to know. Do we want to do that or do we want to do just the training? I mean, it would help.
Jasmin:
It sounds like a good idea.
Cody:
The last time I trained, I was just shooting at trees. Anything they got is better.
Jasmin:
Yeah, I agree. I mean. Well, we'll stick together so you can do the training. I have some reading I’d like to do if that's possible though.
Cody:
Okay.
Jasmin:
I guess I couldn't read the text last time we were in town.
Cody:
When we get back to town, I'd like to do the training.
Charlie:
Yeah! Let's do it. You and me, we will fight some stuff. Jump up and down. 
Cody:
Cool. Thank you.
Charlie:
Great. 
Allison:
The last thing I want to do before we are heading out, I would like to see if I can put some of that web in my bag.
Oliver:
Okay, cool. Do you want to try doing that now? 
Allison:
Sure do, bud!
Oliver:
All right. Make a nature check. 
Allison:
Cool. Great. That's seven.
Oliver:
Okay. Yeah. You take your dagger that you used to cut Cody out of the webbing and you go over and you try to use it to slice a piece of the webbing off so that you can roll it up and put it in your bag or something. And every time you touch the webbing, it shocks you. So you can't hold it and you end up digging your dagger in and you try to pull it back out and it does not come back out.
Allison:
Okay. I am going to then re-summon my dagger into my hand. 
Oliver:
You got, you open up the menu, you press dagger, the dagger vanishes from the webbing, and it appears in your hand.
Erica:
Ta-da! 
Allison:
Erica says and then gives up on the webbing.
Oliver:
 All right, let's check in with Zan in the tree.
Talia:
I am no longer in that tree. 
Oliver:
Yeah. Did you find a new tree or are you just wandering around?
Talia:
I just sat on the ground just.
Alice:
So she does not want to go back up the fart tree?
Talia:
Yeah. No, I don't. I heard that fart. I'm not going up there.
Oliver:
Zan, you're just sitting near the edge of the growth in this clearing and the back your neck tingles.
You feel like someone is watching you. Not malicious, but definitely watching you.
Talia:
My, we're looking over at Talula first.
Oliver:
Tallulah's not looking at you. She is polishing her battle ax, cleaning off all the spider gunk. 
Talia:
Okay, I'm going to make a perception check then. [Rolls] That's a two plus two, so four.
Oliver:
Okay. Yeah. You look around peering into these shadows and you find a trail, a fresh trail made by a creature about the size and shape of a fox. Do you follow it?
Talia:
Hell yeah, I do. This conversation's getting boring anyway, and I'm only listening. 
Oliver:
Zan, you slip into the forest. You follow the trail for maybe like 20 feet into the growth and it abruptly vanishes. It's just gone. And as you turn around to go back to your little camp, you come face to face with a small bronze dragon, about the size of a fox with glowing purple eyes hanging from a tree branch looking directly at you.
Zan:
Hello. 
Oliver:
It kind of cocks its head at you.
Zan
You've been watching us. Can you understand me? 
Oliver:
It blinks.
Talia:
All right. I'm going to, like, slowly sort of move towards it and like, very, very gently, like hold out my hand.
Oliver:
Okay, yeah. As you have locked eyes and like, take a step towards it tenses a little, but doesn't move and you extend your hand. And when your hand gets close, the dragon grabs your hand in both of its tiny little paws and looks you in the eye. And then it bites your wristband. Do you jerk your hand back? 
Talia:
A little bit. I'm trying very hard to keep it still.
Oliver:
Okay, yeah. It's just trying to bite your wristband off. Click, click, click. Like it's little teeth are hitting your wristband over and over again.
Talia:
I’m going to bring, without moving that hand, bring my other wrist up to click the bands together to see if it reacts to that sort of thing popping up.
Oliver:
Okay, great. Yeah. You put your other wrist over the one it's holding on to and as soon as you tap your wrist bands together and that menu pops up, the dragon lurches backwards. It's hovering in the air, flapping its wings, and then it's gone. And instead there's an owl hovering in front of you with the same glowing purple eyes. It beats its wings and lands above you back in the tree, settling on the branch. You blink again and now there is a massive tiger on this branch with vibrant green and white stripes, those same glowing purple eyes. The branch groans under its massive weight. 
Zan:
What are you?
Oliver:
And then the tiger's gone. And it's replaced by a human woman with long, wavy brown hair crouched on the tree branch like a feral beast. She's naked, except for a scrap of dirty cloth tied around her neck like a kerchief. Her skin like ripples. And then she's scaled. And then patches of fur and then feathers. And she's just constantly changing. And she tilts her head to you and opens her mouth, which is filled with pointed teeth.
NPC?
Hello. Hi.
Oliver:
And she smiles. And then she tips backwards, falling off the branch. And you watch as a tear opens in space. She falls through it and she's gone. And then the rip seals itself up. And you were alone in the forest. As if nothing happened.
Talia:
Zan just stands there for a moment, sort of arm basically still where she had it when there was a dragon there and just sort of takes all that in and then just pulls back and like shakes her head and pulls herself together and walks back over to the clearing just like a little bit distracted, but still not going to mention that for now. That was a lot. Okay. Okay, yeah.
Oliver:
As you wander back into the clearing and just stare at the ground for a bit, Tallulah gets up from her a log and comes over and says,
Tallulah:
All right, we've got to find those flowers. You help?
Zan:
Oh yeah. Yeah, I'm good with finding flowers.
Tallulah:
All right, great. They're little gray flowers about the size of a silver piece.
Oliver:
Then she, like, holds her hand up to make a circle.
Tallulah:
They kind of scurry around. So let's go find some. Oh, actually, Charlie, you bring a jar?
Oliver:
And from in the bubble, you hear,
Charlie:
Sure did!
Oliver:
And Tallulah goes and walks inside the bubble. And the rest of you in there see her come over and she's like, 
Talulah:
Hey, Charlie. Feeling any better?
Oliver:
And they're like, 
Charlie:
Yeah, I can move my hands. Making good progress. Ready to go soon.
Talia:
While she's in there can I do sense favorite enemies if I haven't seen it. 
Oliver:
Yes, you can. If you know what you're looking for.
Talia:
All right. I'm gonna try to do my uninterrupted minute of concentration and try to find this little gray flower moving silver dollar sized thing.
Oliver:
Zan, you close your eyes and stand there and try to picture this little creature that Tallulah described to you. And after about a minute, you think, oh, over here. And you walk to the edge of the clearing and nestled into the trees, into spaces where branches connect or under big piles of moss are these little gray flowers, just like Tallulah describes. When you reach for them, they try to like, scurry away on little like viney legs at. But you grab one, it stops wiggling when you pick it up.
Zan:
Hahaha, gotcha. Hello. 
Oliver:
Tallulah comes back with this glass jar that she unstoppers and holds out to you and she's like, Tallulah:
Oh, nice. 
Zan:
Got it. 
Tallulah:
Thought that would be harder now. Great.
Alice:
Can I have come back with Tallulah to help?
Oliver:
Yes, definitely. 
Alice: And then realized that I don't need to. 
Zan:
I did it. I win.
Oliver:
And Tallulah turns back and says, 
Tallulah: 
Hey Charlie, how many do we need.
Charlie:
Oh, oh, I forget, a lot. Get a lot. That'll be good. Hey, I can move my feet.
Oliver:
So the two of you. Yeah. You can make a nature check at advantage.
Talia:
Okay. I got a nine.
Alice:
I got a 19.
Oliver:
Holy shit.
Talia:
Good. All right. Great. Yeah. The two of you, once Zand has got the one that she already caught in that jar. Actually, the three of you with Tallulah's help, you kind of follow Zan around and she points out places where she thinks the plants are. And then Jasmine is, you go into scoop them up. They try to scatter, but you easily, like, pluck them all up.  And you have 19 of these little gray flowers. 
Alice:
Hell yeah. 
Talia:
Nice. 
Tallulah:
Congratulations. 
Allison: Did they have tiny voices? 
Talia:
Oh, God, I hope they don't.
Alice:
That would be really terrifying.
Allison:
Please don't put me in the jar.
Allison:
It's just like a wordless screaming like. That’s good podcast audio. 
Oliver:
The next plant you're gonna have to collect is going to scream every time you pick it up. 
Talia:
That’s good. 
Jasmin:
Good job, son.
Zan:
We thought through our flower puzzle.
Tallulah:
You've solved my flower puzzle. 
Oliver:
All right, great. And you all make your way back inside this bubble where Ash is now sitting up and seems to have regained most of her functionality. And she's going through all of her charms, one after the other. She fiddles with them. One of them lights up. And so she's got like a little flashlight around her neck, basically, and she sorts through the rest of them. She taps one of them against her palms. She licks another one of them. And she's grumbling and muttering to herself while she does this. And Tallulah leans over Charlie. And it's like, 
Tallulah:
How are you feeling, bud? You ready to go?
Charlie:
Yup, definitely.
Oliver:
And tries to sit up and is very stiff. But with Tallulah’is help they managed to get them into standing position and Tallulah looks at all of you and she's like,
Tallulah:
Fully rested?
Zan:
Yeah. 
Tallulah:
All right, let's go. 
Oliver:
Yeah. So your party with your rescued charges starts to head back to the city of Fell’s Keep as you're walking, Tallulah is supporting Charlie under their arm and it's like,
Tallulah:
So I got ask, how did a pair of the Moon's finest end up as spider burritos? And Ash is like, 
Ash:
Listen. 
Oliver:
And Charlie just interrupts and is like, 
Charlie:
Ash was fiddling with one of her charms and walked straight into it. I heroically tried to pull her down and got very stuck. It was sticky.
Oliver:
And Ash is like, 
Ash:
No, no, stop it. It's not like that. Okay. 
Oliver:
And you're walking, like, through the growth. And she's like gesturing. And she's like, 
Ash:
There's this weird disturbance in the growth out here. That arachnid volt that came down was way too big. You know, they're the size of a small desk. Maybe. But that thing was huge. Okay. And the guard, the city guard has been fighting off attacks for years and they are getting worse. There is something wrong out here. Something fucking things up.
Talia:
Hot.
Ash:
The growth wasn't nearly this bad when I lived in the capital. I talked to some of the dragonriders that come through and they confirmed other cities aren't like this.
Oliver:
She's fiddling with her pendants again and pulls out a silver one with a bunch of rings on it that spin and whirl. And she's studying it as she walks and she's like south of here, whatever it is.
Zan:
What's south of here? 
Ash:
This disturbance, this like sting that is just making everything in the growth get worse and worse. And like nobody goes for a walk in the growth. Like, you're gonna get eaten by something. But this is different. This is like everything's just super aggro all the time and big.
Cody:
Isn't your capital south of here?
Ash:
Yeah. It's not that far south. It's near here. I can. I think I can find it.
Talia:
Can I try to magically sense the presence of a planar portal.
Alan:
What?
Talia:
To see if anything's there.
Oliver:
I actually changed that one for you. Okay. Once per short rest, your DM may tell you if you detect the distance and direction too, though.
Talia:
That's much better. You will tell me
Oliver:
Yes. So if there is ever, the rest of you can't hear this. If there's ever a planar portal and you can't, Zan can't see it, then you might have seen one today. But you wouldn't know that. I will tell you that you sense one. 
Talia:
Great, because I couldn't figure out a great reason. 
Oliver:
So you don't have to just every so often stand there and be like, hmm, I wonder if I feel this. 
Talia:
Good. Excellent. 
Oliver:
Anyway, that's her Ranger Conclave's thing. Back to reality. By reality I mean my fantasy world that you must all play in. Yeah, you're just hiking. You get to that edge of the rushing river and Ash is like,
Ash:
There's a fallen tree over there,
Oliver:
And leads you like over a little bit and you just walk across a fallen tree.
Talia:
We all look at each other sheepishly.
Jasmin:
I mean, what we did was very cool. 
Oliver:
It was very cool.
Cody:
Yeah, I liked the water magic. That was fun. Jasmin did good. 
Jasmin:
Thanks, Cody.
Zan:
Nice. 
Oliver:
You all walk for a while. You're making slow progress. Tallulah has to stop you all every so often because Charlie can't really keep up. And they're leaning on her. They're a big person and very fit, but just something about this spider web means that one of their legs is kind of dragging a little. Yeah. You pause for a minute. And it's dark here in the growth. The trees overhead have made this thick, intertwined canopy of branches. And as you're walking, you hear this creaking in the forest around you. It sounds like tree branches bending under a weight they can't handle. Talia:
Perception check.
Alan:
Yeah. Cody starts looking around trying to figure what made sound. 
Oliver:
Okay, great. The two of you can make a perception check.
Talia:
Yeah. I’m gonna roll better this time. I'm not going to roll better this time. I rolled exactly the same. I got a four again.
Alan:
That's an eight plus two perception. Ten. 
Oliver:
Ten. Okay. 
Allison:
Can I also make one? 
Oliver:
I’m gonna say no. 
Allison:
Okay.
Oliver:
I'm going to try to keep group checks to just two rolls. 
Allison:
Damn.
Oliver:
So we don't have to do a million of them. But with a ten Cody, you can see that the forest is a lot denser than it was the last time you came this way. 
Talia:
That was an hour ago, right? 
Oliver:
Probably like two hours. Give it adding walking and stuff, but. Yeah.
Cody:
Does it look any darker in here or there's more stuff than there used to be to anybody else?
Zan:
No.
Oliver:
With Zan’s low perception check.
Zan:
No. It’s just a forest.
Cody:
I thought you were good at forests. 
Zan:
I'm great at forests. 
Oliver:
Just say this is the forest. 
Zan:
This is a forest. Look at trees and everything. 
Cody: 
But there's just more forest not changed.
Jasmin:
 Now that you mention it…
Oliver:
From behind you, you hear Charlie speak up and they're like,
Charlie:
Oh, Ash. Ash, what time is it? 
Oliver:
And Ash is like, 
Ash:
Oh, shit.
Oliver:
And she starts fumbling around with her pendants and pulls one out and her blue green skin turns paler and she reaches back to go under Charlie's other arm. And she's like, 
Ash:
Shit, fuck, shit. It's almost sundown. We have to move fast. 
Zan:
Oh, but yeah, I'm going to follow at the back. Just yeah.
Oliver:
You're all moving and yeah, the forest is really dense. You have to constantly push branches out of the way and squeeze through openings. 
Alan:
Cody emits light from his hoodie so that he can see a little bit better. 
Oliver:
Great. Yeah. Tallulah's like,
Tallulah:
Why? Why? What's wrong Ash? What's wrong?
Oliver:
And Ash is like, 
Ash:
So the growth. Remember how I said it was weird and there's some disturbance or something?
Oliver:
Tallulah’s like,
Tallulah:
Yes. 
Oliver:
And Ash is like,
Ash:
The growth has been closing at sundown down.
Cody:
What?
Ash:
Well, it's sundown. The trees kind of clamp together onto each other and it's impossible to walk through. And I don't really want to spend another night out here. So let's pick up the pace.
Zan:
Suns down, guns down. Let's go.
Cody:
Yeah, let's get out of here.
Oliver:
Yeah. And the forest is indeed changing around you. Now that you know what to look for, you can see that the branches of nearby trees are bending towards their neighbors and intertwining, creating these walls of wood.
Talia:
Huh. Maybe it is a little darker.
Robot:
Do I feel like either Charlie or Ash are slowing us down at all? 
Oliver:
Oh, definitely. Charlie is definitely slowing you all down. 
Robot:
Charlie is slowing us down more?
Oliver:
Yeah.
Robot:
I'm going to attempt to throw Charlie over my shoulders in a fireman's carry and just go.
Allison:
Before he does that, I'm going to cast enhanceability on Max and give him bull’s strength.
Oliver:
Oh, nice. 
Robot:
Yes. 
Oliver:
Right. Yeah. Make a athletics check. And then what does that give him on that?
Allison:
That's advantage. Strength checks.
Oliver:
Perfect. See, you get advantage on your strength and your athletic check.
Allison:
And two times carrying capacity. 
Oliver:
Oh, good. He needs that. 
Robot:
Sixteen.
Oliver:
Okay, great. Yeah. Max turns around and kind of like puts a shoulder under Charlie and throws them over his shoulder and he's like, 
Max:
Let's go.
Oliver:
Just takes off running. Does anyone else have anything they want to do to try to make it easier to get out of this closing forest?
Alice:
I'm going to grab Cody's hand and start running.
Alan:
Can we tell how close we are to the edge of the force? Is it closing in on us right as we get to the edge, or are we still pretty deep in there? 
Oliver:
You're still pretty deep in there.
Alan:
Okay. 
Anyone still got spell slots? Because maybe some fire.
Allison:
Erica is just singing. 
Erica:
Closing time. Time to leave the floor. Before we are stuck for our impending doom.
Oliver:
Great. 
Erica:
And running. 
Cody:
I mean, I could cast fifteenish foot of fire in front of us, but I don't know if a burning forest is better to be running through than a live one. 
Zan:
I don’t know, that’s what they do around the town as they burn it.
Cody:
Yeah, but do they do it when they're in it? 
Oliver:
Ash is like your flame hand, do it! Do it now!
Cody:
Oh, okay!
Alan:
And so Cody will cast burning hands.
Alice:
While holding Jasmin’s hand?
Cody:
I got two hands, two arms.
Talia:
Burning hand. 
Alan:
Yeah. And it's weird. It's called burning hands, but nothing about your hands actually on fire. You just admit a cone of fire from your hands. I don't know.
Oliver:
Great. Cody, you push your way to the front of the group, extend your hand, and a giant cone of flame comes out and it easily burns back the path in front of you. The trees almost seem like they are squirming to get out of the way of the fire. 
Alice:
That's freaky. 
Zan:
All right. Run. 
Cody:
Let's get going.
Erica:
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Oliver:
Cody, are you going to keep doing that till he gets out of the forest hump?
Alan:
How much more space do we got? Because, I mean I have to keep casting it, correct? Every 15 feet to do it?
Oliver:
Right. 
Alan:
Yeah. Cody will cast it again after the next 15 feet. 
Oliver:
All right, great. Yeah. You guys watch as this tiny figure holds up his hands and burns back another chunk of the forest, allowing you to keep making progress. And he does this three more times and you all make it to the burn ring, leaving a wide trail behind you. And just like that, you are back in that flat, charred land outside of the city wall.
Cody:
Oh. That's a lot of fire.
Oliver: 
The sky above you is a wash with a rainbow of colors. As the twin suns dip over the western horizon, almost touching that great purple smear that rips across the middle of the sky. But you're safe. 
Zan:
Good job, kid.
Cody:
That was a lot of fire. Is everyone okay? Did I accidentally…
Jasmin:
No. 
Cody:
I tried not to hit anybody. Did anybody-
Jasmin:
Cody, we're good. 
Cody:
Okay. 
Jasmin:
You did great. 
Cody:
Thanks. 
Alice:
Jasmin gives Cody a hug. 
Alan:
Cody returns to the hug. 
Jasmin:
You're the best, Cody. 
Cody:
You're awesome, Jasmin.
Jasmin:
No, I'm not. But yes.
Oliver:
Yeah, Ash walks forward and kind of like claps you on the shoulder, Cody. And she's like, 
Ash:
Good job. Let's go. 
Zan:
I think we broke Ash.
Ash:
Fuck off. You did good. 
Cody:
Thanks.
