export default `It has been two days since you escaped the underground facility run by CASTR. Yesterday, you stumbled across the family in the woods. Lily, the bubbly, half goat woman, Nula the quiet human and wind rid the grumpy lady with antlers. After spending the day together, they invited you into their warm little living room to spend the night. The first light of dawn trickles into the house in the woods. Cody sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket. He's coloring in his notebook to pass the time until his friends wake up on the floor. At his feet, Erica is curled under a blanket with Jasmin's arm flung over her waist. Their breathing is slow and even a comfortable sound. After the trying events of the last few days,
Cody, you hear a rustling in the pile of blankets by the door and watches and kicks off her covers and groans.
Zan, you wake up too hot. You feel like you're a mile underground, fighting to breathe. This room is too small, the walls are too thick. Cody and Zan, what do you do?
Cody makes eye contact with Zanna, gives a quick wave like kind of a high morning, but without saying anything. Yeah, And then kind of puts a finger to his lips. Kind of a cush points of the other people in the room still sleeping and he even point Zan points himself and point to the door. It makes a shrug gesture in the universal You me
outside question Mark
Zan grimaces and sort of, like stretches a little bit in place and then nods and kicks her blankets out of the way of the door so they broke. Can leave. Okay, both of you make a stealth check. Hey, Sorry, Erica. Uh, that's a 15.
That's a two plus 24
Cody, you kind of try to gather up your colored pencils in your backpack and you go toe jump off the couch, and then you just shrimp over the arm of the couch stand, Make a dexterity saving through.
Uh, that's a 10 minus one is nine. Okay, Cody
just barrels right into you and the two of you land on a heat wave heap on the ground next to the door.
No one else in the room wakes up, though. Oh,
how? Okay. All right, let's go.
Cody starts tiptoeing an almost cartoonish fashion to the door.
Very loud and creaky Zan, you wince every time he makes a step, but you make it to the door and you like, pull it open and step outside of this little stone house into the clearing in the woods outside the air is fresh and easy to breathe. On the other side of the clearing is that glass geodesic dome surrounded by a garden. The moss covering the rest of the clearing glitters in the sun went from a night of rain. You take a deep breath out here and feel instantly a tease.
Oh, nice out
here. So so nuts nicer out here really stuffy in there.
Yeah, the two of your standing
outside and you notice quickly that it's no longer overcast. And for the first time in your short journey, you can see the sky and it's fucking wild. To the north and south, the sky is a soft shade of blue rippled with bands of pink and yellow that remind you of photos of the northern lights across the center of the sky. Cutting it in half is a jagged smear of deep purple. It runs across the entire patch of sky you can see from this little clearing to the east. You
see the light of two yellow
sons almost overlapping, peeking through the trees.
Ah, you
also see Max
outside jogging along the tree line.
Uh, what? Um
Well, okay. There goes my future post apocalyptic earth theory.
First thing you learn in
school when you're learning your colors is the sky is blue.
I mean, there's someone lied or something's really up here.
Okay, But this guy is not always blood. There's like, so many colors of the sky, even on Earth.
But the sky is blue. Grass is green. Saunas yellow. These are basic facts.
Sons is yellow. Yeah, there's two of them. That's weird. Um,
this is a lot. That's weird.
Cody tries to wave and get Max attention. If he's paying
attention. Notes in the zone.
Okay, she's in the zone. He just keeps
jogging. Cody tries toe weight even harder. Seem as if he could wave louder and be more effective. But when it doesn't work, you finally
just yeah,
holds his wrist because it kind of stressed it a little bit waving.
You hurt your wrist waving.
I tried to get his attention,
and I was looking at his wrists. He kind of sees is his SPL.
He's in You. Were you were practising fighting yesterday, right?
Yeah. Very cool, huh?
Um, maybe I should practice doing the spells and
stuff so that I can, you know, get to the menu faster. And like so I can be better at fighting and not almost get hurt like I did last time. Okay? You help
me?
Sure. Did you have, like, a plan for this?
Simply just stands there As if a plan never even crossed his mind. Anything like he's in trouble for not having
one. Uh um, No, I just
Well, what we can just, like, help me find a target. And we can just like, I don't know, makeup, different
ideas of what happens in battle and like to see if I can, like duck and
I don't know, I don't want
to shoot you. That's not my plan. That was not my plan was not a duel. He that
no Well done, Max.
I kind of want to
ask him before I shot spills at him and he didn't pay attention when I waved him real hard.
Uh, fine. Well, what suppose you got?
Well, I got light, Major hand and
Braila Frost are the ones that I can use a lot off.
Okay, so let's stick with those, okay? Just in case. Well, lights, you seem to be pretty proficient at already. So I
got that went down, and then he immediately, like, just, like, makes his hoody glow for no reason whatsoever.
Rad. How about can I look around to see if there's anything you know that we could practice on That maybe we could set up somewhere else, are I could hold out or something?
Let's see. Yeah, you take a look around the clearing. That practice dummy that
you were fighting yesterday has collapsed back into a pile of logs and you don't know what spell or thing that when Drew did to make it stand up. The pile of rocks from the Gollum is gone, So that's weird. And the
clearing is
surrounded by just like a bunch of trees. So you could probably just, like, pick a tree and shoot it. That tree.
All right, let's start with these streets over here at the edge of current. And I lied Cody over toe. You know, like about God. I don't know how far you can shoot spells like 20 feet away from the tree line. That'll work. Let's start by trying to get it between two trees. And then if you're good enough that we could see if you could try to hit a tree. Okay, so I say Ray Frost, because you can't really shoot May chant at things.
Okay, he'll he'll get his card out of his pocket, you know, in his chosen fighting stance, and heal quickly like fast. You can his wrist together, get the menu and hit right a frost and try to get it between two trees. Go ahead
and roll in attack.
That is a six plus 4 10
a. Yet there's
a decently big gap between trees that zayon pointed out to
you and you shoot a
beam of silvery energy through it That smacks something in the forest. Kind of See some birds go fly away
like nice. They're
fine. OK, um, why
do you need those
cards? Doesn't get in the way of you like opening up the menu and tapping.
Could he looks down at his cards and then have looks up it. Zan squints trying. Decide how much toe to tell her. He's like,
Well, um, they're my friends. I mean, I had him for a long time. Here, let me just show
you. And he kind of holds out of the cards and a fan. When Zan looks at the fan of cards, she'll see that they all have a picture of a creature looking thing on the top half. Um, and then on the bottom, right hand corner of their number, Do you see? A various number is a 19 and he shows the card he was just using and on top, you see this four legged, ice covered creature that is shooting a snowball out its mouth, Could it goes,
Well, this is this is chill aama and I drew her a while ago. And then when I discovered I could shoot a nice B, I just I thought of her and I thought it be cool toe. Think that dilemma was there with me helping me, you know, fight and I don't know, like when I'm when things get intense and we're fighting Who Who wouldn't wanna
have Ah, an animal friend with you to kind of keep yourself company.
Oh, and here's the newest. When I made
on the bottom, you see, it's number 15 and of all the cards, it looks brand spanking new. The other ones is they lower numbers have wrinkles. They've been handled. This one looks like it was drawn days ago. And on the top half, you see a little white hand with a face and red accents.
Well, when I got major hand, I realized I didn't have Ah, a creature that went with major hand. So I drove on and I named him Help. Oh, see, look,
CIA make hamburgers coding
kind of looks down, ashamed that she figured out his inspiration.
That's Cody on that. They're pretty cool.
You look up and
Max is standing right behind you. Also looking at your cool cards.
Okay, Max Zan asked about my cards, and I was showing them to her. See, here's chill Lama, and here's help. Oh, and oh, here's my first car I ever drew. It's a skunk,
and sure enough, you look at the card top half. There's a vague, skunk shaped creature, but instead of normal black and white, it's oranges and reds and yellows.
Yeah, it's it's gone, but, uh, he shoots fire out is But while he was
named Sparky when I first came up with him because you know, fire but checks told me, actually, little bit more creative
with my name's if I could and, like, you know, mix the animal name And like the element together on DSO, I was like, I know and so here this is this punk it's for
sparking is gonna put
together things. This book, I think that's great. But yeah,
he's really cool.
Great. Then it's just sort of nodding vigorously like she started out, just sort of like nodding slowly. And she's just like Cody
looks up and sees them both smiling and nodding vigorously
and okay, I'll show you another one. Uh, here's flower all
my psychic owl with spiral. The eyes plow with the
big guys. I thought they think they could glow, and that could be were where light came from. My spell light. So yes, just whenever I'm using my spells, I just pretend I have my my code. Eamonn, with me. I know it's
silly. Could he looks down at his cards,
but it helps me focus when I get scared or things get bad,
silly can be pretty cool sometimes. I don't Don't know a lot about silly, but I, uh think it that this is cool for you. So, uh, yeah. Forget what I said about taking the time to take him out. That's a Z. Uh, had on may be well, when we can figure out a way that for you can get him out faster or something. Quickest draw and the wherever we are. That sounds like fun. Yeah. Alright. Well, why don't you put him away and weaken? Try take him out a couple times to see. See how fast year.
Okay, he puts in his pocket. You're gonna like countdown
now. No, I'm not gonna tell you when it's gonna happen.
Okay? Test. Be a surprise. Even that is ready. Stance like hands. Kind of almost like a western like hand over his pocket. Just kind of
waiting. Draw. Okay.
Make a slight of hand check. Three plus 14 plunges his hand in his pocket, rips out all of the cards, and they just go fucking flying. There's words everywhere. No, no, no, no.
Okay, well, I'll help him pick about okay? Yeah,
it's the three of you helped gather of the cards Z
and you
catch a
glimpse of something moving in the bushes. Could you make a perception check for me?
Ah, that's a 16.
You could have sworn
there was someone there watching you. Just a moment for a moment.
Hey, you guys finish gathering bees up. I'll be right back. OK, guys need to check that bush create Zan. You make your way
into the bushes, you try to, like, put together what you saw. Like your best guess is that it was a person standing there with long curly hair and you go and you find the spot where they were standing. But then the trail immediately vanishes.
There's no turnout. All I can't like No, no trail, huh? That's really disconcerting, because I'm really good at
trails Zan says to the wilderness.
All right, I'm just gonna put my hands my pockets and sort of casually turn around, walk back towards them, but, like, keep an eye on that spot just from time to time. Look back over there,
Okay? Why don't you make
another perception check for me?
That's a five. Yeah, You keep glancing over
as you and Max and Cody practice him getting his cards out of his pocket and then shooting some trees with Ray of frost. But you don't see anything again.
Can I get a better D 20 now?
Throw that one in the garbage.
Yeah.
So the three of you practice
this for a bit? It's
a nice day
out. The sons are kind of cast in light onto your little clearing. It's still weird.
Yeah. Just got to be ready, Cody. All right, so any time I might do that, any time you're in the next couple of days, just be, like, drawing. You're gonna have to try and take them out as fast as possible. Okay? How do you watching? We're gonna be We're gonna wait and see how this goes. Okay? All right. From somewhere high
above you, you all hear a noise
hoof. Uh, and you look up
and you see an enormous creature with giant, leathery wings descending on the clearing.
Uh 00 All right. I'm gonna grab Cody and run towards the house.
Oh, no. It doesn't really matter
what it is right now. What's Max
doing? Yeah, Max is gonna just run
behind them. OK, but keeping an eye on it?
Yeah, As you run up to the little house, the wind kicked up from this creature's wings sending dust and leaves and, like, swirls all around you, making you shield your eyes. But you do make it to the door. You
inside? Yeah, there's a thing. Think there's a thing.
There's a terror attack.
I'm like pushing Cody ahead of me getting Come on. It's a thing. Yeah,
You tumble into the living room, shutting the door behind you, and you find Jasmin and Erica still asleep on the floor and they wake up to the sound of you guys show to get, um,
guys, get up. Get up the thing. This is a big bling bling thing. With what? What? What's going on? It's a terror attack. It'll tear it ducked.
Erica scratches their head.
The swing swing thing.
I don't get a good look at it cause it was really big. And there was, like, like behind it and was a big thing. And ah,
hide. Hide. Uh, Okay. Where? I don't know. Should we get Lillian New? Uh uh, yes.
Are they? Are they outside and the other
here. I mean, they're not in this room
with, you know, Cody,
huh?
You look around this room there, not there.
Zan opens the door just like a crack toe. Look back outside, See what it is.
There's also a
window you could look out.
Oh, that looks out the window. You see
a enormous creature landing in the clearing before you is a dragon ho. Who should? It's at least like 30 feet long and covered in pale pink scales that glitter in the sunlight. And you can now see that someone is writing it from a saddle mounted just behind its enormous head. The dragon's head is about the size of a small car and has four glinting green eyes. Yeah, as you watch it, the writer dismounts and you watched them pull a large bundle off the dragon's back and remove the saddle and then start walking towards the house.
Can I flee into
Ah Holway? Yes. Just go for it. Make a stealth check over eight
16 minus 1 15
Yeah. Jasmin just bolts out of the room and is gone.
Cody's gonna dive under the couch, make itself that is a 19 plus 2 21
Holy shit. Okay, Cody flattens himself. Could it disappears like you. You had Jasmin and Cody there,
and you look around and they're not there anymore.
Can I see you? The person walking tried to the houses? Yeah.
The person's getting closer there, tall and sturdily built. They have a pair of antlers sticking out of their curly hair. They look like they're wearing like gray leather armor goggles and a cloth pulled up over their mouth and nose. Yeah,
I I think when this is so much just gonna, like, sit there for a second, just like watching like that was a fucking dragon. What? Yeah. Did we
see where the other three went to bed last night? That they let go upstairs? Yeah, There's, like a narrow little staircase, and they went up there. Okay, Max is gonna run over to the stairs. Just yell up the stairs.
Hey, uh, were you expecting a guest? Okay. Yeah. You hear some, like
thumping and rustling and someone going like And then Lily comes trotting down the stairs and she's wearing that big puffy bathroom that Erica was wearing
yesterday. And she's like, What? What you. Sorry. It's very early. Get does it? There was
Ah, dragon. And now there's a person.
Oh,
from from the dragon.
Oh, my God! Oh, my gosh on.
And then you hear a loud knocking
on the door, just like a thumb. And Lilly runs over and throws the door open and his
like, Rami. And then she runs out the door
and gathers this big man up in a big, big hug. And the two of them are excitedly greeting each other on the
front step. OK, E think you
can come out, Cody? I don't know where. Jasmin What? Are
you sure? Shit. Where the couches talking. You don't understand how you see you, Donna, I think has been very cautiously
pokes her head around 1/4 of the door.
I think that the lily seems to know
Cody's brave enough to have justice head sticking out of all the couch
coach with head on it. This terrifying. Yeah,
through the open door, you see Lily and the man she called Remmy walking back towards the dragon, they're excitedly talking to each other. Lily turned back to the house and she says,
Oh, um, come on, Come on. Come meet Comey. Grammy
maxes out the
door. Okay. Uh, what won't
we get eaten? Lily can't
hear your question from their Jasmin, but
Yep. Max,
you go outside, and you see Remmy rifling through this, like being bundle that he pulled off of the dragon's back. And Lily is just, like, chattering at him, excitedly telling him about a bunch of plants and stuff like
that. Yeah, I go out there, all
right? Yeah, I'm going out as well. You
guys wander outside and you see me pull this like, long stick with a bunch of bristles on it, out of his supplies. And as he's talking to Lily, he starts just scrubbing the dragon like it's a big tooth brush. And the Dragons starts like lifting its back leg and kind of like something it a little bit as he gets the spot, like right on its neck. Does every thump, like shake the ground a bit? Oh, definitely. It's a lot, but this dragon looks very content. And Ramey's talking to Lily, and he's like, Yeah, sorry. Um, sorry. I'm here so early. I know we said next week, but I just I got this great deal Taken some shipping. Uh, West and I
Oh, there's people here. Hey. What? Oh, right. Yes. Oh, Um uh, yes. Uh, these are our guests who we met yesterday. They emerged from the forest, and they've been sleeping in her house. This is
Erica. She her and Jasmin. She
and she kind of, like, goes through the list of you, and she's like,
and this is Rami. He him the sir Nephew. Hey, Brings us supplies from time to time. It just wasn't expecting him so early.
Hey. Hey, roomie. So, uh, nice to meet you. Hi. Sorry. We yelled when your dragon appeared. I'm guessing you didn't actually hear that, but we way weren't It was It was like a It was a cool, cool yell of surprise.
Okay, I'm not gonna
make you roll the deception check for
that. Dumb remedies
Stop scrubbing the dragon is kind of like, oh, uh,
high. Wait, where did you come from? Um, just and Lily's like, Oh, they all have amnesia. It's so weird. But they don't know it's that funny. They're heading south
by this point. Cody has worked without the couch. You have been watching from the door to pick its head out watching the scene
it is it okay to come out now? Yeah, we seem
good. Okay, so he kind of looks around. It's like,
Is that a pterodactyl? No. What is it?
Oh, uh, this is back. She's ah spoke to, uh we were on ah, shipping together
high beck
The dragon swivels its massive head around and looks at you and Cody. You get a look at these four green eyes. Nick tilts his head to the side and then scoots its head all the way up into you and just nudges you right on the stomach.
Oh, hey.
It's kind of like getting hit slowly hit by a car. Um, make a strength saving throw. 00 yes. The strength saving group
think Cody is great at
poor baby boy. A
small child. That's a 12 minus 2 10
Okay, nice. You just kind
of stumbled backwards. And Rumi's like,
hate hate back. Come on, come
on. He doesn't have any treats and kind of like puts up a hand, pushes her face out of the way, which
clearly doesn't actually push her out of the way,
But she does move her head when he pushes on her,
you can stay behind me. Cody.
Cody like to get off the ground is actually kind of smiling a lot. She's fun on
and ready smiles that you didn't like.
Yeah, yeah, she is. This
is weird for me, but ah, I mean, since you're here, you want to help me bring these ah supplies inside me like gestures to this, like, bundle that he took off the dragon's back and pulls down the outer layer, and it's like a big tarp wrapped around a bunch of boxes and crates. There's, like, some big bags of flour and rice and stuff like that.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sorry. I'm sorry. You
just, like, pick something up and starts walking towards the house.
Yeah, I I go to pick something up.
Great. Yeah. Grab like a big bag of rice following towards the house.
Yeah. Erica starts caring things. This one
on the way back to the house. Could I do a quick check back where I saw the person? Possibly. Yes. Make a perception check. Uh, that's a That's a 15. No, you still can't spot anything, huh? Ok,
there's, like, a
weird looking couple of creatures over there that you hadn't noticed before. They're kind of like crows, but then they're kind of like jumping and calling and is one turns around. You see, it's got like, furry back legs and a long tail that stripes you're, like, less weird.
Oh, okay. I keep going into the house. Techno that later.
Cody is enamored with the dragon. Kind of misses the whole point. People start moving, things they find sees people helping any comes back and forth with the stuff that dragging the stuff in the dragon. And it just hits his wrist together, reduces made hand and has them a chance. Start moving things back and forth while he stays the dragon.
Okay. Um, yeah, What's the range on major hand?
It's a 30 foot range. Is that enough to get to the house?
No, but they can only live £10. Guess what?
Whatever. Whatever is under 10
picks, it picks up like a an
apple or something and takes it 30 feet and then puts it down. And then it's like making a pile of apples. That's 30 feet. Definitely help. Oh, being a to this point, Max has been like hanging a little bit back from the group and just staring in all at this dragon and then furiously scribbling in his notebook. Yeah, and when he sees people start like moving around, he kind of snaps out of it and goes to help them move
things. Okay, Justman helps to. Okay,
also, yeah, Rami directs you when you go out of the living room, there's, like, a kitchen area with a big table, and he's like, just set most of it here under the table. Uh, I guess. Okay. And then, like, goes back out to the dragon. Lily has also picked up, like, four crates and is easily walking them towards the house. Yeah. So
most of
you spend a little time doing that when he gets back over to the dragon. Remmy looks at you, Cody, And then, like, looks up at the dragon, and it's like you spend much time with dragons. Did
you just say dragon is this
thing? This is an actual dragon.
Uh, yeah, not an illusion or anything. Ah.
Oh. Where I'm from, dragons are only, um, told him stories. Uh, I have never seen
one, uh, early. You came from north of here.
Ah, sure.
Did we come from north of here?
You did. You were following a trail south. Technically, uh, yeah, yeah. They don't know. They don't just dragons up North Korea. Don't do so well in the cold.
Oh, does. Does she eat
Berries?
Uh, I guess she probably eat the whole
bush. Uh, she found one.
Cody wants to rummage in his backpack for the spare bury that he stored back the first time. That good, very.
Do you rummage
through your bag and
surprising me? E. Guess you don't find
a giant smear of very surprising your all knowing God. There's no big, very mess. You don't find the berry in there.
I thought I had
a very
sorry I've kind. You another one to the other time.
Yeah. Uh, that's fine. So So grab a snack, Which is tired of watching you all. Yeah.
And you notice the dragon sitting there looking at all of you, kind of swinging. It's too big. Tails back and forth slowly. Remmy looks up at her and slaps around the leg, and it's like going go play. We got stuff to do. And the dragon bounds off the ground shakes under you with each like, big leap that she takes. She heads over to the stream and settles down and starts drinking out of it.
Zan watches the dragon go. Kind of. Sadly, just it doesn't say anything. Just like, yeah,
Max is doing the same. Yeah,
I see most
of you are have stopped midway between the pile of stuff and the house, and I just like watching her. She kind of like drinks for a bit and then looks around, looks at Remi, who is, like, taken another armful of stuff into the house. And then once he's in the house, she just rolls right over into the stream and starts sloshing around on her back, getting kind of mud everywhere. She's all dirty now.
Over. I'm so sorry, but this is a dragon
watching podcast. Now. Next 10 episodes are just following this dragon around. Yeah, like sand stents. Completely stout to moving. Great. Hello. Welcome to dice Disasters, which is now apparently, about watching Dragon's
robot. Are you excited about just, you know, shifting our podcast focus at this point? Yeah,
I feel like we've had
quite a few paradigm shifts in low in the last couple episodes. First we were a rat in the woods. And then, Ah, now we're dragon podcast. So, uh, really changed things around, keeping it fresh?
Yeah.
We don't get too bored with our stories far. So yeah, I'm really glad all of her since that it was time to, like, just become, like a nature podcast, but focused solely on dragon care dragon behavior. We get some data that Inbar voiceover to go along with our Ah, that's a terrible joke. No one's gonna get that joke. I barely
get that joke. I understood it, but
I've never watched a David Bad Borough documentary.
Oh, I know, I know. He's a big name. Now, I'm tempted to leave this part in, but anyways,
thank you for listening to. Our podcasts were so happy that you'll have come with us this far. We had a bunch of really awesome people reach out to us this week, Especially since we've changed our schedule. People really happy that we've gone weekly for the little bit robot. Have you seen anything online that is excited? You know,
there was there was some fan art on Twitter of Zan in the Thinking math Lady team. I don't know the exact name of it,
but I thought it was just hilarious. That was amazing. Yeah, some of the fans air just like knocking out of the park. And we love seeing that stuff because you showing how much you're enjoying the podcast not only makes us feel great and like, where people are enjoying what we're making, but it also helps other people who might not be listening to us know how much fun you're having listening. And we want this group of people to grow. Yes. So go on social media, share your art and your love of the show on Twitter using the hashtag dice disasters or a tag ascend hashtag on
instagram. Just let people know how much your loving it.
And if you do do those things, you could get your name in the show as, ah, as an NPC. Yeah, we're compiling a list every week of names of people who have shared the show for Oliver to look at and use and coming up with names for new NPC. So, yeah, get your name on that list and by sharing the show and if you
have ideas for an item that you want to see at some point in the show, you can go submit it on our website. Yeah, and maybe that'll be Show up at some point.
Oh, yeah, That'll be fun from the cast and especially Oliver, who told me specifically to tell everybody that your kind words and your enthusiasm means so much to us. You know, we're doing this for the fun of it. We love hanging out with friends playing this game, and we love making this for people. And so hearing that it's brightening up your day is make is brightening up our days.
Yeah, we're all constantly yelling amongst ourselves about all of your kind words and fan art and things.
Yes, definitely no. We see it and we yell constantly about it. It's so great. But hey, we wish you all the absolute best. We hope you're staying safe and staying healthy, and we're so happy to be able to do what we can to put a smile on your face this week. And with that in
mind, let's get back to the story. See around God. I really want to play with Dragon. I think, as everyone is watching this Jasmin
Bulls probably say to whoever
happens to be nearby. Like, Yeah, I guess it would be pretty dangerous if I turned into that.
Yeah. Who are you next to? Good
question. I don't know.
D four or something rolling could be for it's a four.
Did you decide her with its A four. Which is Cem? Okay, cool. Hey.
Yeah, that's probably not a great idea for keeping it on the d L, but it'd be pretty cool. Haw
would. But I don't think I like being that big. Actually, as
you're talking about that he come the little cat slash goblin with clover on his back. Kind of like steps on your foot and looks up like starts putting his head against your knee. Jasmin, is
there anyone watching the I mean, you're kind of out in the
open where you're standing right
now, so no one's watching you. I think has been, like, looks to the left, looks to
the right and picks up teacup. And then try sit like one around the corner of the house.
Make a stealth check. Yeah, Let's look at 19 minus 1 18 OK? Yeah. Zan Jasmin was
standing next to you saying something about a dragon? You were kind of looking at the dragon and nodding, and you turn and look at her and
she's not there. Why the fuck does Jasmin keep vanishing? I don't think she
has invisibility. I would looked at her spell list.
You look down instinctually, there's no rat on the ground, but yeah, Jasmin,
you're tucked around the other side of the house. You don't think anyone saw you?
I'm gonna pet teak open. Then don't call the very cautiously scam. Um
great. Yeah. Out of your wristband comes this little flared beam of light. That kind of goes like
speakeasy like scans him up and down
when it's complete, the scan button graze out. And you now have a little three D rendering of teacup. The cat in your
wild shape list, I think,
has been ah, hugs. Teacup puts it
down and then very excitedly, like
collapse or halves, because he's just a sissy. Assist assistance Green Jasmin. You get eaten by a rock monster? No, I'm good. Actually, I want to show you something to you. Come here. That sounds suspicious, but sure. Okay. Zan. Yeah. You come around
the side of the house and Jasmin is standing there.
Look, look quickly.
I look Jasmin is pointing at teacup, or I imagine it's just kind of chilling. Yeah, he laid
down in the sun is like licking his butt or something. And then she opens up her meds. You and push this wild shape.
Oh, okay. Oh,
Zan uh, since you're staring right at
her, you watch as in, like, a split second. Jasmin's eyes grow really big and her pupils turned to slit and her nose just jut forward out of her face. Oh, and then she shrinks. And for ups all over her And there is no two cups on the ground, one of whom is like looking at you with its mouth wide open like,
Hey, Okay. Should you really
be doing that right now?
The tea cup has been cocks. Her head on them looks really sad.
Oh, okay. Now I like it's it's cool. Like it. Don't Don't get me wrong. This is really, really cool. But
Jasmin make a wisdom saving through. All right? Ah, four plus 30 you would
really, really like to go chase that shiny bug that just started into your vision is
very shiny. Look at it go. I think you can
see Jasmin's pupils dilate. She doesn't like cats, but wiggle on and she just hops
away friends after, OK? Oh, no. I'm gonna run after Jasmin. I guess I like, put this stuff down at
this, right? You put you put like
a bushel full of weird looking cucumbers down on
the ground next
to you Teacup, who is still licking his butt and
run off after Jasmin Max, I left some stuff over. Bred teacup. We're back. You can follow
her. She's like jumping through some like patches of long grass and then through the garden.
I'm not going to stop her, but I'm gonna, like, make sure that I'm always just sort of following
the rest of you.
You finish bringing the rest of the supplies inside, and then I imagine you all kind of congregate back out in the clearing, watching this dragon out of the corner of your eye. You see Zan running through the garden like Sam. Anyway,
that's a funky
dragon That's a dragon And Zan is being completely normal. Revenue comes like
out of the house and sees that back has rolled in the stream and it just
like Come on, I just washed you
on. He, like, rubs his hands down his face, okay? And then, like, stomps over to where it back is laying in the stream.
Come on, get over here.
And she's like, now, like playfully jumping away from him and like, wagging her tales around, enjoying him, chasing her,
Just just get out of the money. I don't care. Just get out of the
mud and easily shooing her. And so she kind of like, trots over to the edge of the clearing and you hear a massive crack noise and see that Beck has pulled down a tree at the edge of the clearing. Ramic sighs and puts his hands on his hips, turns and walks back over to where Lily is standing and they start talking. You watch the dragon just methodically poll all the leaves off of the tree, and then she, like, lays down and props the trunk up between her front feet and just goes to fuckin town. Chewing up the wood of the branches,
Cody has sat down, crisscross at a distance that he feels is safe from the dragon. But he's just there to, like, watch this dragon do anything. It does great. I'm just coming all
great. There's kind of,
like chunks of wood splintering off and flying away from the dragon where it's eating this tree. Eventually win. Drood has come outside, and it's kind of like also talking to Remmy and Lily
after a couple minutes,
you see, Remi, look at all of you and then look back at Lily
and then be like, Oh, OK, I guess I guess some had note now. Ah,
I won't be able to get you your next run until two weeks after a normal date,
but should be able to do that just fine. Uh was kind of like, looks it,
Erica, Max and Cody, who are standing slash sitting, watching the dragon
and wave slim is like, I thought there were more of you, but all right, I guess. Ah, by then,
upon hearing that dragon leaving soon might be happening. Yeah. Cody is like,
Hey, wait. You're going
tomorrow? You just got here. Dragon jurors got here. I didn't even get eternal the dragon yet. Guys, where
you going?
Mommy is like,
Oh, um, we just we were on supply shipments. Like, got a job at West Stow. We're heading down toe, fellas, keep gonna pick up a shipment from there. Take it. Take it out to my next next job. Uh, do
you all live here
now? Uh,
could you look to Erica sick?
Oh, you have the map. Where we
going next?
Actually, I was gonna talk to everybody about that, but it seems like the most logical place is fells. Keep. How long does it take you to get to? Fellas, keep,
uh, with that, um, without a load. Were probably about an hour an
hour or so if she's fully loaded up, maybe two, because to to get here.
How long does it take to walk
there? I don't know. I have a dragon much faster than walking
peasants without your dragon. Lily has come over, and she's like,
Oh, it takes like a week, a week or so to walk there. I've done
it a couple times.
There's some nice spots to camp along along the river, and, uh, it's not too bad. Is that where you're going? Down toe? Yeah,
We I couldn't think of anywhere else that we should go. But Erica kind of looks to Max is like
that makes
sense, right? Like, we should probably go figure out where we are, what we're doing. Where to go next.
Ah, you weren't We were me doing something on the way here.
That's all. Your Roberts? Yeah. Oh,
yeah, The fabric. I wasn't paying attention. Where? Where it went after this. Where is Zan? And where is Jasmin for that matter?
You, uh you turn and, like, look
around the clearing and you see Zan
doing this like weird hop jump skip movement through the garden She looks super awkward. Zan zin, get over here.
Oh, I, um I, um it's ah, cannot do. What do I have
to, uh I mean, what are you doing? Are you just chasing the cat? Yes. Yes, it's, um it got it. Got a thing. And I had to I need to make sure that it doesn't swallow it. Oh, my gosh. Is, does the cat have hap and Erica runs over? No.
When? When Erica gets calls, I'm like, No, it's it's That's the cats, Jasmin. Right now I'm so making sure he doesn't run away like you did when she was a rat.
Oh, uh, she, um uh, how long did it take
for Jasmin to change back? I don't remember. Eric is looking so anxious right now. Jasmin is
rolling around in some girl. Yes.
Yeah. You've got
up to where you don't have to run anymore.
She's teacups. Kind of like a light colored cat.
And this one is now dusty, kind of dirty, Very content.
Um, I don't remember because I was so destroyed. It was it was the Berries.
And so she pressed it and they went over the Berries. Got I don't remember how long it took. I wasn't I'm not good with, like, time amounts when I'm not tracking people.
Okay. Yeah, that that makes sense. I am very concerned that Remi over there, who already thinks maybe we're a little bit weird. A little bit strange. I'm very worried about him. Seeing Jasmin turned back into Jasmin. So, like, I don't know what we should do. And Eric is like, visibly lake sweating.
I'm just gonna here, I'll grab cat Jasmin and just, like, run her over back, sort of around the house to the other side, from where we are right now.
Cody, completely oblivious to everything that's happening, is just going to start asking tons of questions about dragons because he didn't realize he had a timer till the dragon was leaving. And so now he wants to know everything about this dragon.
Okay, great. Yeah. Um, I'll say that
Cody has Remmy and by extension, Lily completely distracted. Just talking about dragon stuff. Yeah. Max is also there just listening. Great.
In the middle of asking all these questions coating it finally has the courage to ask the question.
Um, so if you wanted to how many people
could you take on your dragon?
Uh, back. Yeah, Uh, she's not really not really used to being a subtle dragon.
She seems nice, though. Maybe she'd want to help people out.
I mean, yeah,
we just don't know. Kind of like our our thing going. Haven't really thought about doing a career change in tow. Uh, shuttle work. I mean, I could do it if things you know,
Cody's eyes have glossed over
people. Um, yeah, ready? Kind of rambles on about career
trajectories for a while. He's, like, not
great it talking.
Okay, but really, how many people? Oh, um I think
shuttle dragons on their fully outfitted and carry Probably like 30 30 people. Maybe 30 back years. Never, Never. We never went
that route. I mean, Gene Gary, like a couple of tons of gear. Pretty sturdy, aren't you? Back And he's like scratching the toothbrush thing on her. But where she's, like, covered in mud. And he's like, You're so gross. Anyway, um, where'd you ask?
Oh, uh, can't Looks over a max trying, like, play it cool.
Um, no, No reason. Just just curious. Never seen the dragon before. Uh,
okay. Meanwhile, behind the house, Erica has followed AZan so
that guys
leaving. And as far as I can tell on this map, it's
gonna
take a week for us to get anywhere else that their civilization. Do
you know where
that path of of the great jumpsuit was
going?
I mean, roughly south, but that's about all we know. It could set. Like if we're following a trail, it could suddenly sort of change directions a little bit.
Erica is kind of looking back and forth and says Right, um, so here's the question. Do we want to go down to the nearest town or do we want to continue falling that jumpsuit? Because I I feel like I came out of the tube and you were the de facto leader a little bit, um, so and she's like wringing her hands at this point, she says, I I don't know what we should do
now stands it blink.
Pretty taken aback at the fact that she's the de facto leader, Jasmin make
a wisdom saving throw advantage. All right, that would
be a nine and 12.
Okay, at this
point, you kind of shaking off the effects of being like, super into being a cat and are just like sitting in
Erica's arms at this point
curled up there. It's warm, your in the sun and you
realize that Oh, wait. You know, Erica, you know
Zan, and you can hear and understand everything that they're saying.
Okay, we should follow the scraps, right? Like they're the only lead we've got to anything. Right?
Right. Um, I guess I guess the thing is, do we do we know that the hunter is someone that we can trust in someone that will help us or is figuring out those court and it's gonna be the best move.
I don't know. I'm I'm worried that we're going to get to a bigger town, and we're gonna be so incredibly out of place that we're going to get into a lot of trouble or something. I don't We don't know anything about about the customs, about anything. It's like it's like when I played the third installment of a video game and I don't know any of the history. And then I accidentally fuck everything up by siding with the wrong side that everybody else knows. It's bad. That makes sense. I
think Erica, you can kind of feel Jasmin's for stand a little on edge is if she's getting really nervous listening to this,
I just don't know. I get the forest that makes sense, OK, but if you want to get back to civilization like you
know, I mean, I don't know what the hell we're doing, but if you think that we should keep following those scraps than no one's do that and Erica kind of absent mindedly start stroking the cat that is in her arms, always. She's very sorry. Actually, Air kick, make a
strength saving throw
that is a seven. Yeah, you
collapse as suddenly you are holding Jasmin
bridal style like sideways, and you fall and she's on
top of
you. And
yet you're in the dirt. Now I got I'm so sorry. You okay? Yeah. I think
I was startled more than anything. Um, welcome back. Glad to have you here. Welcome to the discussion. Were
you able to understand us? I don't
know how this works.
No, I was I I followed most of it if I got a little distracted by a bug at first, but, um, I I understood it.
I don't Yeah. Uh, OK, uh, are you sure you're okay with not going to I don't Not going to the city.
I mean, we don't know what's gonna be there. We don't know anything. And my gut isn't telling me that I need to be anywhere specific. I don't know if we can figure out Ah, good hiking situation than I think this will work. Find
I'm a little scared of getting walked up. It's it sounded like Like what if they can figure it out somehow? Like there's someone there that has, like, some magical goggles and concede e shifters in the forest. I think I'm a least somewhat safe.
Yeah, that's fair counterpoint. Were falling a trail for a man called the Hunter.
Maybe it's just like a name like, you know, Hunter who, like, I feel like they're people that call their kids. Hunter, how
many people call their kids? The
Theo did you Did you feel that? The instinct to be like
I got a cool new fantasy name in this world. I know. I felt a little bit of that. You know
what? What? You have cool new fantasy. Maybe,
Uh, I mean, I hadn't thought about it that much.
See them then? The hunters kind of weird,
but like the room was already hunter.
Well, you don't see me changing my name to Jasmin plant, and my name is over. A teacher husband
will be kind of a cool name, though
Erica just gently whispers to herself the Erica i e just I don't know. I don't want to encroach a lily and New and Windwards time too much, you know, And And Erica's looking nervous again.
No, I get it. They've been really nice. There's a lot of us. They have just a cute, cozy house, and I was thinking how overwhelmed I would be if five strangers suddenly showed up in
pools. Yeah. No, I think leaving makes sense, you know, Weaken. Hopefully, maybe come back some day and and repay them in some way.
Yeah, that would be nice.
Maybe we can
find out how to contact Remmy. If we get to fellas, keep. We can ask Grammy maybe how we could find him. And maybe we could catch a ride back here. If if we need Teoh,
a pink dragon. Sounds like it would be fairly notable and probably easy to find.
I don't know. Maybe we're lots of pink dragons in towns here. Maybe it's the new thing.
Just every family has their own pink dragon. The houses are enormous. Erica points up at the sky and says, we woke up the two sons this morning. I don't know what's usual anywhere anymore.
Yeah, that's Yeah, we know nothing. Yeah,
The two sons kind of put a dent in my apocalyptic future. Think,
right. I said I thought the same thing. The three of
you, like huddled, talking behind the house. Here's someone clear their throat and you look up and you see Nula is kind of leaning out the window and they, like, wave down at you like
high A I am I might
be able to help. Uh, some of your problems come, come meet me over by RMI. And then they, like, disappear back into the house.
Oh, no, They were listening. Well,
I guess let's go.
We got we go find new. Uh, Okay. Great.
And then pick up. Made this new kale fins for toothless on and then they could fly together on and then they work together and they figured out how to make where, like, humans were afraid of dragons anymore. And they became friends. And that's how the first movie ended. And then there was a second moving. And Rami
is like, crouched down next to Cody is telling him the plot of how to train your dragon and is totally enraptured. She's
like, Yeah, OK, what what happens in the second movie?
They look
like they haven't actually a pretty good time. As Erica, Jasmin and Zan reappear on the side of the house, they see like Mula, walking across the clearing towards where everyone else
is standing near the dragon who has finished chewing on the tree and is just laying on her side in the sun.
All of her question and my cover. Good
dirt. Yes. Not covered. Like you didn't roll in mud or anything. Yeah, you're
pretty dirty. Okay, maybe you want to dust off your skirt,
Dusty Jasmin.
While Cody is telling the story, Max is gonna walk over to the dragon and, like, very cautiously try to put a hand on Mike a foot.
Yeah. You walk
up and you see the dragging following you with her eyes and you walk over and cash Isley reach out and put a hand on her foot. She's got, like, big, clawed feet, and she immediately snaps her head up and over and just bumps it right into your chest.
Make a
strength saving throw. Oh, God, that is 10.
All right, you stumble back a little bit, actually. Just kind of, like,
bumped you in the chest and then let out a big breath on you. It's kind of like know how idea that audio is gonna sound.
She kind of, like cocks her head and looks that you let bumps you
again. And this time you're expecting it. And she just, like, seems
to enjoy bumping you in the chest
with their nose. I'm tryingto petr under the chin like a dog. Oh, she fuckin loves that. Yes. Soon as you start scratching under there, her whole head just tilts back And you gotta use, like, both hands at this point because her heads like the size of a small car. But yeah, you get under there and you see your one of her back legs just lift up and start flailing in the air. She'd love that yet, Max Max just spends the rest of the time just petting this dragon everywhere. Things. This is great. The best day yet. The rest of you make it over to the group. You see Max under the dragon's chin just scratching away. You see Remi and Cody sitting on a patch of moss with Cody animatedly telling Rami the plot of how to train your dragon to which room he loves. New look waves you all closer and they look at Remi and they say Rami and Ramiz like, oh, uh, pause on the story. Uh, hey, Auntie Nula and he liked goes over. Gives them like a kiss on the forehead and a little
hug and then stands back. It's very good to see you. Um,
I was
wondering if, uh, when you were down in I'm pretty much any city
view and heard any
rumors about the hunter and remedy, like tilt his head back. Uh oh, yeah, I did, actually, I think there was, Ah, a guy down in the capital got into some bad, bad trouble down there. A few different rumors. I heard that some guy columns of the hunter with, uh, with this other fella older fellow with him. They, uh they maybe got involved in some fighting rings. Don't know how true that one is. You know, everybody likes to pretend never one else is in the secret underground fighting ring. Another person said he may be. Ah, killed a guard. And I heard of a few people saying he, uh, the old fellow he had with him was a shifter and, uh, fucking exploded or something. I don't know how true that you know, people are with the shifters, but far as I know, he was barred from the capital. Maybe the whole kingdom. I don't know. It's
like a year ago, six months something and knew. Little nods at this in tow. Use an And can I talk to you for a moment? Yeah. Yeah, sure. They kind of pull you away, and you hear Lily behind you Be like
And also what happened with the wrestling ring? Did they've ever figure out, uh, kind of, like, who was running in, or do they do they solve the mystery?
And she's, like, very excitedly waiting for more hot sauce from Remi, who indulges her, but yeah, Mula leads you away from the group for
a minute and says, I think there's something weird going on with the five of you, Uh, to put it bluntly, Yeah. So, um, like I calling himself the Hunter passed through here. Well, right after he passed through, we had some strange attacks. I don't know. The wildlife seem to get pretty riled up when he came through here. And, uh, that gollum you fought last night. That's not normal for us. And so, to my best account, kind of piecing together what little information I have, You think we're attracting weird animals? Maybe. Maybe it's a coincidence, but, um, I worry for you. If you were to walk all the way down there. The growth isn't a isn't a forgiving place. I think you should, uh you should take a ride from Grammy down to town. I think it'll be safer that way. And it sounds like the hunter made it down there.
Right? You're probably right. I just don't I feel so weird. Last night, just like inside I got I felt stuck. Uh oh. Uh, just I don't I don't want to know how. Don't necessarily want to go to town. I
just I'm sorry. I should have Should have asked you last night. There's, ah, bed made up in the greenhouse where I usually sleep. Could have had you sleep out there. I just like being with plants on. Sometimes the house gets too stuffy for me. You get that, fellas. Keep is Ah, haven't been there in a while, but it will probably be a bit of a struggle for you. That's how you're feeling, but the capital is green and nice. I think you'll like it there. Okay. She, like, puts a hand on your shoulder. And is it a squeeze? Insists you're tough. You manage. All right. Thanks, NASA. No, And then
they turned back and walk over to everybody where Lily and Rami are now listening to CODIS explanation of the plot
of the DreamWorks movie.
Yeah, it once it gets to a certain point in movie three, where, like, lots of humans are writing on lots of dragons. Cody just stops in the middle of the story. Wait.
Oh, hey, guys, Come here, Quick, Quick, quick. Yeah. Uh um, So stay with me. But I asked me earlier if that could carry people and eat. He was a little wishy washy on it, but I took the answer to be a general. Yes.
I mean, I think I was pretty concise, but OK,
what if
instead of walking all that way and being so bored, What if we flew on a dragon down to somewhere that place
we were going? Are we going to a place?
That's a great idea, Cody
and Cody is surprised his idea was accepted, like,
yeah, it's a great idea. We one of a starter. Yeah,
it's Ah, wow.
I'm gonna be like a cup
and Cody to start kind of jump up and down, maybe kind of getting closer to Max and the dragon.
All right, all right. Keep your legs on.
Erica looks at Zan like, bewildered and confused that the plan has changed.
Zan just kind of like, puts a hand her forehead and closes her eyes like I, like, make some sort of gesture. Like we'll talk about this later, Go with it,
Erica, Like, nods and is looking so confused and anxious. Great.
You see, the Nula has, like, pulled Rami aside, and it's like talking to him in low voices and Miami, like, looks up at the five of you and then nods at Mula. So you want to ride to town? Yeah, that'd be great. All right. Uh, new look, You think you could do the the thing again on new look nods. So Nula walks off towards the tree line and kind of makes like a noise gestures to Beck, who excitedly gets up kind of Bull's Max over in the process and follows Nool over to the trees. Newlog positions her next to this, like, nodded and gnarled tree that's covered in vines. And you watch as they put their hand on the tree and close the rice.
Oliver S s. I see this can I try to join in and help her? Yes, OK, Jasmin. You
quietly half jog over to the tree where Nula is standing and they look up at
you. I gesture at the three and make like a questioning face that cam I they put
your hand on the tree and then put their hand over top of yours and
the closure and just breathe when I breathe and
the two of you breathe in unison and you feel the trees start to move and the rest of you watch as the like branches of the tree creek and turn and start to sneak over. The dragon's back there, twisting and reforming. And you watch as Nula, with Jasmin's help, coaxes the wood out of the ground and into the shape of five seats on the dragon's back, the vine snake under the dragon's belly, securing this big contraption to her. She fidgets a little bit, but then is chill. Nula pats your hand. Jasmin was like,
you hope a little bit. You gotta
work on it, but
you'll get there. Thank you, Rock.
Cody's jumping up and down. He sees the new seat sees like it's coming true. he's gonna write a dragon. He said,
wow When
he runs upto lily
we're gonna write a track and we're going to go toe Dragon to a town. Oh, you are, You are.
And she just picks you up and kind of throws you in the
air and then catches you like you would do with, like, a cobbler.
And when we get there, can you show me around town and can we Can we go do some stuff and like and like, really explore
it? Oh, oh,
Cody, I'm gonna I'm gonna stay out here. Um well, I'm gonna stay here. Uh, this is my house where I live. Oh, but I'll sure I'll see you again. And you'll have so much fun in town. Um, Thea, the start of summer festival is coming up. Where me Did they still celebrate the start of summer festival?
Uh uh, Yeah, actually, in else keep, they'll have, like, a thing.
Oh, great. Yeah. You could get flowers in your hair and, uh, get lots of candy and complete games. And a wonderful you'll have so much fun.
Oh, um, well, this thing Thank you for for letting us stay here. Um Oh, you're
so welcome. Thank you for coming to visit. We haven't had
visitors in a very long time. And Cody and she, like, leans in close, and she's
like, You are my favorite visitor. You can always come here.
Okay. Okay. Before you go, can I Can I ask you to things just to Yes. Okay. Um, first is you've told us about the hunter, and you told us about town and everything that you know are Is it safe? Oh,
yes. Oh, yes, yes. Actually, out here
is probably one of the
more dangerous places that
you e.
Most people don't live out here in the growth like we dio. They like, uh, settle into
towns
where they have a
strong walls and they burned down the growth around them. So nothing can sneak up, and you'll just you'll you'll be very safe there.
It seems like your friends
really care about you, so they'll
they'll keep you see? Okay,
it's a little bit more relaxed. It goes,
and lastly, and you've been so nice. And I don't want to ask you for too much. But remember when I when I
was sick, when I was feeling a little
blue earlier. Yes, Um, you gave me some medicine and Oh, yes. I don't know what other things are out there that might hurt me, but, like, do you have more medicine in case?
Oh, um, let me
see. Let me see. And she she's like, coming. And she like Casey by the hand and leads you towards the big glass geodesic dome. And as you get up to the outside and you see that it's kind of like foggy and there, and she puts a hand on the edge of the dome and it the like, piece of glass. It's there, just rumbles for a second and then slides into the ground. And you see the inside of this, like huge greenhouse just full of plants. And she, like still holding your hand and leads you over to a desk.
Eso uh, I write this book and you can find it in some shops in the kingdom. I don't have any extra copies.
I just kind of have my leg, the the notes that I've made and then I hand them off. But I do have some notes. You see her draw some pages out of a pile and she, like, stacks them together. And she says, Thes ones are,
I'd say
the most hit or hip. I don't know what kids say
cool plants of the reason thes ones
come in extra handy, and I
would like you to Happy's
and she gives you about six pages of drawings of plants, little like notes written beside them and drawings of like vials or things like that.
He'll gladly take them, opened his backpack in his notebook and stored the notes in one of his school notebooks where his papers are Once he's in there, he looks at me and he looks a bit lately real quick, and he carefully pulls out another piece of paper from the middle of the notebook.
Um, I don't have anything useful but him. Here's a drawing. I did this this morning,
and it's just a really rough drawing of their house with the three of them, with all of our party kind of out front. Ah, maybe we're really rough Rock column outside.
It's the Rock column, angry or smiling, dead.
It's on the ground with exes over its eyes.
She takes this page from you and, like
tears are welling up in her eyes and
she's like, Oh, my gosh, I like
in the middle direction. He just goes on and just and just gives, I guess. Probably one of her legs. Biggest
hug buster. Oh, she scoops you up and
just, like, picks you up and hugs you and gives you, like, 40 kisses all over your your little face. She's like,
you're my favorite little guest ever.
He's like, Oh, Oh, thanks. Thanks. Really,
Your hair is ruffled.
Um, your You're really kind. And I'm gonna miss you. Thank
you, Cody. So are you. And I'm gonna miss you, too.
In the moment that you put him on the ground, He's going to just take off running, putting his backpack on its back and catching up with the group.
So you're all standing in the clearing? Remmy has gone around, checked the vines, that air holding thes wooden makeshift chairs and place on Becks back. And he has re attached to the saddle Teoh just behind her
head. Like looks at the five of you. And he says so. Uh, you You ready to go? I got to meet somebody later today, so can't stay much longer.
Yeah, Yeah, I think I think we're already.
Uh huh.
All right. Uh, Lily, you, uh, help me give him a hand up. And so
Lily and Remmy help you up onto the dragon's back. Then as you go up, one by one, Rami jumps up there with you, and he's got, like, a length of sturdy rope and that he's uses to kind of like fashion seat belts around you. So you're solidly tied in. He leaves little not of it on your lap so that you could untie yourself if you needed to, but
so it's not too kinky. It's not kinky.
One of you is a white light. Sorry does Cody. First, it's not kinky. The rest of you, it's a skink. AEA's. You want it, Teoh? Do you want to make a kinky check with this? That's a podcast name. Yes. And alright, roll a D 20. Ah Ah, That the six. Dan, it's not
kinky for you. You
feel uncomfortable things. Man is tying you
down like you were a child in a child seat. And that is not one of your things.
I can hate car seats in
the worst. Anyone else really kinky? Check my 12.
Yeah, I got said. Yeah, Jasmin, You're like, Oh,
this is kind of nice. It
feels secure. Jasmin feels a little bit safer. Yeah. You feel you feel nice, Max. You get tied
to your chair and you're like, Oh,
that's all thier
12. Get 20% of a boner.
Erica, did you roll a kinky check?
Thank you. Troll. Kinky checked. Pluses,
too. Kinky checks your charisma. In that case, I got a four.
Um, yes, he kind of, like, tightens it too tight.
And you get, like, a little bit of a rug burn on your arm. And you're
like, I hated that. He's like, Oh, sorry. I don't do this. Uh, okay. Goodbye.
And it's very awkward. Jumps down off Becks back the five. We were strapped in. Like old wooden roller coaster. Rami takes a moment. Is Lily another hug? Same with Mula. He, like, bends down and gives Wynn dread a kiss on the head. Windward husband drinking from a cup of tea And like, not helping with anything and just scowling at everybody and hear her as like Remmy says by She's like it's too early. Next time. Come in the afternoon. we'll come back to bed. The sucks
by idiots.
She like, gives the like, half hearted wave at the dragon, and that just trudges back towards the house. Maxwell's coach, Lily and Nula, take a step back. Rami climbs up onto the saddle and you feel the dragons enormous body lurch under you as she unfurls her wings and leaps, your stomachs drop out as you watch the ground fall away. You're rising higher and higher. Tiny house in the woods gets smaller and eventually is lost in the sea of trees beneath you. After what feels like an eternity, the jarring flapping of wings evens out into a
peaceful glide, your strapped to the back of a dragon with a strange new
world A mile beneath you, Remmy turns around in the seat and gives you a thumbs up as he looked at the world.
