export default `Oliver: You're standing at the edge of the burn ring, having escaped the closing walls of the growth. They're still smoldering from Cody's flurry of fire magic, which kept the trees at bay as you made a hasty escape from your mission to rescue daughter Charlie and daughter Ash and collect the gray flowers. You pick your way across the craggy, burned landscape towards Fell's Keep. Beyond the walls of the city the sky is awash with even more colors than usual as you watch the two suns set. You trudge forward, exhausted, into the city. You pass taverns that are alight with music and laughter, you pass darkened shops, and finally, you see the building made out of black glass that serves as the city's headquarters for the Daughters of the Twin Mountains.


Oliver: Standing at the entrance, you see Jack, the young moth-winged woman who sent you on this adventure. She's standing there, bouncing on her toes with a sharply dressed woman with cat years and a humanoid creature that looks like a lizard person in gray robes. What do you do?


=== INTRO THEME: “Elysia” by People Need Goals ===


Zan: Did it. Got 'em. Look, found 'em!


Jack: You found them! You found them!


Oliver: And Jack is like hugging all of you again.


Zan: Oh--- uh, oh--


Oliver: She's like, openly crying. She just seems like she cries a lot.


Zan: Great.


Cody: There were spiders and they bit me.


Jack: Oh, that's awful. Oh, you poor thing. I'm so sorry.


Cody: Made me feel tingly. And weird.


Jack: New sensations that are always like that, huh?


Cody: What? No--.


Jack: Was it kind of like a sneeze?


Cody: But in reverse.


Talia: How are we role playing Cody going through puberty already?


[Laughter]


Alice: They up grow so fast.


Oliver: Sorry, I couldn't help it.


Robot: When Jack gets to Max, to hug -- Max is still carrying Charlie.


Oliver: Yes.


Robot: So Max just kind of shrugs Charlie off his shoulders onto the ground and picks up Jack again.


Oliver: Oh, yay. She's like,


Jack: Oh, you rescued them! Yay!


Oliver: And Charlie's like,


Charlie: Thank you for the ride here. Oh, I'm tired.


Zan: You're tired?


Charlie: Oh, I still don't feel good.


Zan: You got a lift!


Oliver: Jack like, leans down and hugs Charlie and then hugs Tallulah and then kind of gives this little like half bow at Ash. And she starts like telling Charlie and Ash how she hired you to go rescue them and get the gray flowers. And that green scaled lizard born person hobbles up to your group and looks up at Ash, and she's like,


Dana: Did you find the gray flowers?


Oliver: And ash looks at you and is like,


Ash: You guys did most of the work, but would you be willing to give her – give Dana – some of the flowers you found?


Zan: Yeah, I wouldn't know what to do with these. Here.


Oliver: And Dana sees the jar that's like full of them – I think you got like 19 – and she's like,


Dana: Oh, I only need three. They don't keep very well, unfortunately, and I need three to make a batch of antidote.


Zan: Great.


Jasmin: Can't you just plant them?


Dana: No, they don't do that. They just kind of scurry around and make trouble.


Zan: Could you make more antidote?


Dana: No, it doesn't keep very long.


Zan: Do you want me to just burn them? Like– I don't–.


Oliver: She reaches into the jar and takes three and closes the jar and just like puts it back in your hands and Ash is like.


Ash: Can you take daughter Charlie with you, too? They're not doing so good. The, uh, arachnovolt paralysis took a toll on them.


Oliver: And the lizardborn woman is like,


Dana: Yes, I will do that.


Oliver: And she reaches down and just like effortlessly picks up Charlie and is like,


Dana: Okay, thank you, bye.


Oliver: And like, hobbles off down the street.


Alan: Cody peeks around Max and Jack.


Cody: Nice to meet you! Bye!


Dana: Nice to meet you, too. Thank you for this lifesaving ingredient for my special antidote.


Cody: I'm Cody, by the way. He/him.


Dana: Bye, Cody.


Zan: No, by all means, stay and talk.


Dana: Bye.


Zan: Oh, OK.


Oliver: The sharply dressed woman with cat years and like piercing yellow eyes, kind of like saunters over smiling and she looks at Ash. She's making a gold coin dance over the back of her knuckles. And she says,


Liz: Offer still stands.


Oliver: And Ash, looks at her and says,


Ash: So does my response. Come with me, daughter Jack, Tallulah. The rest of you wait here.


Oliver: Jack kind of gives Max one last hug and like, climbs off of his shoulders, and Tallulah sighs and the three of them walk off towards the tower. So, the five of you are now standing outside this tower and this cat-woman is there.


Talia: Catwoman's there?


Oliver: Yep. Catwoman's there.


Talia: Big fan.


Jasmin: Um, hello?


Oliver: And she smiles at you and says,


Liz: Well, it seems you rolled into town and found quite the adventure.


Allison: I would just like to say what a missed opportunity for Catwoman to say, [Southern accent] "Well, hi!"


[Laughter]


Oliver: Sorry.


Allison: You're doing great.


Oliver: She says,


Liz: I offered these fine adventurers a gold apiece for any extra gray flowers that could bring me from their heroic journey. Seems they're not interested. If you've happened to find any, I'm happy to buy them from you.


Erica: Boy, do we have some for you.


Zan: Why didn't they give it to you?


Erica: Well, I mean–.


Zan: Do you do really unethical stuff with it? Like–.


Liz: Oh! No, no. The Daughters of the Twin Moons do not like money. Is the best way I can put it. They don't deal in exchanging of coins for goods and services.


Zan: Great.


Liz: But I do.


Zan: Yeah, I think we do.


Jasmin: What do you need them for?


Liz: Ah.


Oliver: And she flips the gold coin over and it vanishes and is replaced with a white business card that kind of shimmers in the light from the street lamps.


Cody: Whoa!


Oliver: And she holds it out to you and she says,


Liz: Liz Graceling, she/her, procurer of fine magical items and ingredients.


Cody: How do you do that?


Oliver: She like holds it out to, I guess, Zan, who's standing in front.


Zan: Oh great, thanks.


Talia: I take it.


Liz: A gold apiece if you have any of those gray flowers left.


Erica: I...


Allison: I kind of turned to Zan and say,


Erica: We're not going to do anything with them. I mean...


Zan: Yeah. No.


Erica: We might as well sell them or they'll just go to waste.


Zan: Yeah. All right. That's fine with me.


Talia: I hand the jar over.


Jasmin: I was just going to suggest releasing them in the garden or something. So this is fine.


Liz: Ah! Thank you very much.


Oliver: And she takes them and she slips the jar into her bag and pulls out a handful of gold coins, which she places in your outstretched hand, Zan. And you now have 16 more gold.


Talia: Nice.


Oliver: And she says,


Liz: If you find anything else interesting, just whisper it to my card. If I'm in the market I'll find you.


Zan: Oh, great.


Oliver: She winks and saunters off.


Alan: Cody's standing next to Zan with his hand outstretched, looking up.


Cody: Uh, do I get an allowance?


Talia: Zan looks at the other adults in the group. For help.


Alan: Cod looks around and is like,


Cody: We just won.


Zan: Yeah. No, I–.


Max: Do I get an allowance?


Zan: Are we just splitting this?


Allison: Erica holds her hands out.


Erica: Money, please.


Zan: Oh, my god. Sure. Just split it evenly?


Erica: Yeah.


Zan: I mean, it was 16– there's–.


Oliver: Yes.


Talia: Damn it. That's an annoying amount.


Oliver: You already have one and a half gold. If you recall, when you rescued the cat Peanut and gave Peanut back to his owner, Clarence, Clarence gave you 20 silver pieces.


Robot: Ah, yes.


Oliver: And then you gave five silver to Tallulah for staying in her hostel overnight.


Jasmin: Yes.


Oliver: So you have 17 and a half. So you can each have 3.5 Gold.


Talia: Great.


Allison: [Vocalizes Zelda victory music.]


Talia: You solved your math puzzle, for us.


[Laughter]


Alan: Cody immediately takes one and starts trying to turn it in his hand, trying to turn it into a card over and over and over again like she had just done.


Oliver: Make an arcana check.


Alan: Oh. Okay. Was not expecting this to even possibly work.


Robot: You get a nat 20 and that gold's just gone forever.


Alan: Well I got a 17 + 2. So a 19!


Talia: Well, I guess you're out a coin!


Oliver: All right, nice. Yeah. You watch as Cody flicks the coin over and over and over and over.


Zan: He's gonna drop it.


Oliver: And as he's doing it, nothing's happening for a while. And then little pink and purple sparks start flying out as he's doing it.


Cody: Oh!


Zan: Whuh–


Oliver: And Cody, you take this to mean like, oh, I'm getting closer!


Cody: Okay, uh–.


Oliver: And you keep going and you keep going and you keep going and you keep going. And then just for a split second, you're holding a card. And then the coin's back.


Alan: He looks around to see if anyone else saw it.


Zan: What?


[Laughter]


Robot: Max is watching.


Cody: What– did you see that?


Max: Whoa, yeah–.


Cody: Like–.


Oliver: [Sarcastically] You almost did magic! How incredible!


Max: But– what would you cards say?


Zan: You can shoot fire out of your hands.


Max: And can we whisper to it?


Zan: What.


Cody: Well I don't know. It doesn't, it's not here anymore. It went away. I don't know. I'll keep trying.


Alan: So Cody just, throughout the day, just whenever he's bored, is just gonna sit there and try to get it to stick around.


Oliver: Awesome. Yeah. The five of you kind of hang outside dividing up your money and watching Cody attempt coin card tricks. And Jack and Tallulah they come back from inside and Jack runs up to you, gives each of you another hug and she says,


Jack: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all so much for saving daughter Charlie and daughter Ash. I don't know what I– what I– what I would have done without you. I know– I know I said I could pay and I meant that! We don't lose money, but I can pay you with a blessing from the moons!


Oliver: And she's like giving you, like, the biggest smile. Like, this is the best thing ever.


Zan: Nice. Not– Yeah. Good. Excellent. Awesome.


Max: I mean, a blessing doesn't sound like a bad thing.


Jack: Oh, it's super nice. It's the best. It's so fun. It's fun for me. As fun for you and it's fun for everybody.


Cody: Like, are we going to have a meal and then have the blessing before? Is that what we're doing?


Jack: Uh... We can eat if you want. Let me get you some food.


Oliver: And she rummages in her pockets and pulls out some bread that she's half eaten and has wrapped in some paper. And she's like,


Jack: Here.


Cody: I mean, I do–.


Jack: Here's some bread. I can get you more food later.


Robot: Max takes the bread.


[Laughter]


Oliver: Just takes it from the child?? Not for Cody! For Max!


Talia: You're just like, yoink!


Oliver: Max, you eat some bread. He's hungry. Boy needs his carbs.


Max: I need calories!


Cody: OK. What's a blessing?


Oliver: Tallulah looks up at the sky and then back to your party and says,


Tallulah: OK, let's return the armor we borrowed. And then we can go get you some blessings.


Max: Aw, do we have to?


Zan: Yeah! Look at how good his tits look.


Oliver: And Jack is like,


Jack: Oh, oh! We talked about it, right?


Oliver: And Tallulah is like,


Tallulah: Oh, yeah. So... Jack and I talked about... That armor. She says it doesn't actually belong to the daughters.


Jack: I don't even know where it came from.


Zan: That's convenient.


Jack: You can have it.


Max: Oh hell yeah.


Jack: OK. Yay! It looks really good.


Oliver: Tallulah's says,


Tallulah: Let's go return the rest of the leather armor. They don't have that much here. So you should give it back.


Zan: Yeah, for sure.


Oliver: Tallulah leads you inside and through that big circular room to the armory and helps you put all the armor back, except for Max, who gets to keep his shiny titty window chainmail armor.


Robot: And assless chaps.


[Laughter]


Oliver: And assless chaps. Yes.


Robot: Ass is not actually out. There's still jeans under there.


Oliver: They're still jeans.


Alan: Important.


Robot: Maybe... Maybe someday.


Oliver: Oh, great. And then when you come back upstairs, you find Jack standing in that big circular room and she's smiling at all of you and fidgeting a little and like rocking up onto the balls of her feet and then back down. And she's like,


Jack: Okay. Blessings. Come on. Come on. One at a time. Who wants to go first?


Cody: Me! Me. Me. Me!


Alan: Cody's hand is raised.


[Laughter]


Oliver: All right.


Alan: Cody runs up and just like stands there, like very proud, like expecting to be knighted or something special. Spectacular.


Oliver: Perfect. All right. We'll do this.


[Laughter]


Oliver: So Jack leads you to the center of the room and on the black floor, there are two intersecting white marble disks. And Jack carefully moves you to stand in like the exact center. Above you, you can see that the ceiling, like, reaches all the way up into the small glass tower, and you can see that it's clear on top and you can see stars and stuff.


Oliver: Cody looks up like that and then turns and looks over her shoulder at the group and gives a big thumbs up and a big smile, big cheesy grin, just like,


Cody: Eee! Look what's happening!


Talia: Big thumbs up back.


Oliver: He would be putting his goggles on if he had goggles. Yeah, great. So Jack positions, all of you where Tallulah's standing at the edge of the room. And then she runs around turning like these little like cranks and she's adjusting the angle of all of the mirrors until she finally adjusts one and you can see that she's like somehow rigged up the mirrors to reflect the moonlight on to Cody.


Cody: Whoa.


Oliver: Tallulah has backed off and is like leaning against the wall and picking at something stuck on her ax. Ash has also come back and she stands off to the side, kind of watching Jack scurry around. Then you can see that Jack has adjusted all of the mirrors so they're reflecting moonlight on to Cody. And it's  a pretty faint light. Moons aren't that bright. And then Jack backs up to stand with the rest of you. And she presses both of her hands to her chest. And the room is silent. And Jack says,


Jack: We are the daughters of the twin moons. We are a borderless organization for good. We go anywhere and everywhere we're needed. We help people without expecting anything in return. We freely teach others to protect themselves. Our tenants are relentless kindness and bravery. Cody has helped us on our quest. And I humbly ask that you bestow upon him a blessing.


Oliver: And suddenly Cody is bathed in moonlight. The intensity of the light has amplified to a point where you can barely see that Cody is even in there anymore.


Cody: I didn't cast light. That wasn't me. Not this time!


Zan: This isn't one of those things where if he's unworthy he's going to get disintegrated, right?


Jack: Sometimes!


Zan: OK.


Alan: It was fun playing the game with y'all.


Oliver: Oh, Jesus has seen your dirty thoughts and now you die.


Talia: [Pained] Cody's dirty thoughts.


Oliver: Cody, I need you to roll a d20.


Cody: Sixteen.


Oliver: Okay, great.


Talia: You die.


Oliver: As the light hits you, it seems to focus in on your backpack and your spell cards are pulled from your bag and they like swirl around you in the air. The moonlight shrinks into a rectangle floating among them. The cards come together again, neatly arranged into a stack and float in front of you. And as you reach out to take them, the moonlight fades and you now have a new card on the top of your deck. It matches the rest of your other cards with like a drawing of a white furred monkey surrounded by snow. This card is like iridescent when you tilt it. The monkey's eyes seem to follow you.


Robot: You got a holo card.


Talia: A shiny!


Robot: Special edition.


Alan: Cody's eyes get really big. He's like thinking to himself,


Cody: I can't fight that kind of paper.


Allison: Blue Eyes. White monkey.


Oliver: Yeah, actually, all of you from where you are, you see, the moonlight has lit up these like runes on the ground around Cody and they're now fading. And Ash is walking around with like a notebook and like furiously writing. And then as they fade, she looks at you and she says,


Ash: Okay. That card is a spell. Sounds like you can now summon a pack of snowballs. Okay, sure.


Cody: WHUH.


Ash: Not the weirdest blessing I've seen.


Cody: Like a snowball fight?


Zan: Pack like... sentient?


Oliver: In game mechanics, you can now cast the spell "snowball swarm." It is a second level evocation spell.


Allison: Question.


Oliver: Yes.


Allison: Does that show up in Cody's spell menu then?


Oliver: You got to ask him that.


Allison: I don't think Erica would.


Robot: Nah. Something to see later.


Oliver: You don't know.


Cody: OK, cool. A monkey... I don't have a monkey. OK. Awesome.


Oliver: Oh good. I was like looking at your drawings and I was like, I don't think he has a monkey...


[Laughter]
Oliver: Like, what other animals, does Cody like?


Talia: It's like a parent going through a child's stuffed animals. You don't have one of those, right? He's got a rabbit, he's got... Two bears. Not a bear, okay.


Cody: OK, I can't wait to, you know, get in a fight with a snowball monster and have some ammo.


Oliver: And Jack comes over and she's looking at your car and she's like,


Jack: Oh, my God, it's so pretty. I love it.


Alan: Cody waves it in the air, like almost so fast that no one can really see it. Like, it's not really actively showing someone. It's just little kid energy. Just shaking it like,


Cody: Look how pretty it is!


Jack: Oh, that's so great.


Alan: And then he runs back to the group and is just like,


Cody:  Look, look look look look!


Oliver: And Jack's like,


Jack: OK, who's next?


Max: Oh, me, me, me, me. I want to go.


Zan: Yeah, go ahead.


Oliver: OK. All right. Max, she positions you in the center of the room and then repeats the blessing. This time the light swirls around Max and then it plunges into your chest, too, filling that heart shaped pendant with light and then fading and the runes flash and then disappear. And Ash is writing and then is like,


Ash: OK. This one has a name, I guess. OK. Cold heart pendant. If you hold it in your hand and tell it something selfless you're about to do, it will help you out. Interesting.


Oliver: And she is writing a lot of notes in her journal.


Zan: What if you lie?


Oliver: She shrugs and she's like,


Ash: I don't know.


Zan: All right.


Oliver: So in game mechanics, once per day, you can hold the pendant in your hand and describe something selfless you're about to do. If you let go and it's turned red instead of blue, you'll get advantage on the role you make for the action you described. Does that make sense?


Robot: Yeah.


Oliver: Sorry I didn't have you roll because I wanted yours to be that one.


Robot: That's cool.


Jack: OK, who's next?


Zan: Zan, holds out a hand. Either of you two?


Jasmin: Um. You can go.


Erica: Yeah, go ahead.


Zan: OK. Guess it's me.


Talia: Zan walks forward.


Oliver: Great. Yes. She puts you in the center of the room. Can you roll a d20 for me?


Talia: Maybe! [Rolls] That's an eleven.


Oliver: Ooh. Yay! OK. OK. So the moonlight flares again and wraps around you coating your chest and your waist and your arms before fading. And you are left wearing a set of black studded leather armor that shimmers faintly in the light.


Zan: Nice!


Jasmin: Wow.


Max: Whoa.


Oliver: And Ash is like walking around and looking at the runes and she's like,


Ash: OK, that's a nice set of armor. It's got magic in it that will increase your... I think reaction time.


Zan: Cool.


Oliver: So in game terms, you now have a set of your very own studded leather armor.


Talia: Yay!


Oliver: Which has a base AC of 12 plus your DEX. And for opportunity attacks you gain +2 on your attack and damage rolls.


Talia: Nice.


Jack: Okay. Okay. You're next.


Oliver: And Jack like grabs your hand, Jasmin, and leads you to the center of the room.


Jasmin: Uh! Ah! Okay.


Zan: It's fine. You'll be fine. You'll be fine.


Cody: Jasmin, it's really fun!


Zan: Don't be nervous.


Jack: Yeah. Don't worry. It's good. It doesn't hurt. It feels nice.


Cody: It's shiny.


Oliver: Jasmin stands in the center of the room and the moonlight flares again.


[Dream music begins]


Oliver: Jasmin, when the moonlight hits you, you're filled with a sense of calm contentment. You close your eyes basking in the healing light. You feel like you're floating. And you open your eyes and you're in an endless nebula. You hear a voice.


Dream Voices: Ah. You *are* growing, actually. Take this. A blessing for a hatchling, budding with moonlight.


Oliver: The voice is familiar and you reach out your hand instinctively trying to draw closer to them, but your hand closes around smooth metal and you blink your eyes open to see that the light has faded. You have one arm outstretched holding a black metal staff adorned with twin silver moons. The rest of you saw Jasmin close her eyes and they moonlight form a staff. Nothing special other than the complete lack of runes lighting up on the floor.


Zan: Cool stick.


Jasmin: Uh, thanks.


Oliver: She kind of like clutches it to herself and looks up and down.


Jasmin: Was that good?


Oliver: Ash has her eyebrows furrowed and is staring at the floor where the runes should be. And she's like,


Ash: That's... Odd. OK.


Oliver: And like, makes a note in her journal.


Zan: Everything OK?


Oliver: In game mechanics, you now have a staff that adds +1 to your spell attack rolls and lets you cast the spell moonbeam.


Alice: Cool.


Oliver: So you now know the spell moonbeam.


Talia: [Imitating Sailor Moon] Moon prism!


[Laughter]


Robot: Oh my God. Jasmin is Sailor Moon.


Alice: Hell yeah.


Talia: We just broke the campaign wide open. They're going to have to rewrite it!


Allison: Give Jasmin a cat. Give Jasmin a cat.


Oliver: Jasmin turns into her own goddamned cat!


Alan: Cody runs up to Jasmin. And as he's running, puts his wrists together and calls out his quarterstaff. He's like,


Cody: Look! Staff friends.


Jasmin: What if we have like.. Like a ritual where where we start fights by doing like this?


Alice: And Jasmin holds hers out and like crosses her stadd with Cody's. Like two spearmen at a castle door.


Zan: Guys, don't touch staffs.


[Laughter]


Alan: Cody does his best to like match posing as best they can. The height difference makes it difficult, but he has his arms stretched as high as he can to try to make it work.


Zan: Well, if we're all done comparing sticks...


Oliver: Ash is, like hovering like right next to you now, Cody and his like,


Ash: How did you– how did you do that? That's so cool. What is this? Can I see it.


Oliver: And she reaches out her hand.


Alan: Cody hands it over and is like,


Cody: You might not believe this, but it's magic.


Oliver: And Ash is like,


Ash: Yeah it looks magic... This isn't a kind of stuff I've seen before. Is it a summoning spell? Do you keep it somewhere and then it appears here?


Allison: Erica summons her dagger and hands it to Ash.


Ash: What? You can do this too? How did you do that? Let me see. What's the thing on your wrist? How does it do it?


Allison: Erica just says,


Erica: No no no. Just look at the dagger.


[Laughter]


Oliver: She like, narrows her eyes at you and turns back to Cody and she says,


Ash: Small child. Show me how you made this appear.


Allison: Does she still have it in her hand?


Oliver: Yeah.


Allison: OK. Erica wants to summon the dagger again.


Oliver: It vanishes from her hand and it appears in your hand. And she's like,


Ash: Oh. Hmm. Let me see.


Oliver: And she flips through her journal and she's like,


Ash: Might be soul bound. Is it soul bound?


Cody: You said summoning... Like, if we leave it somewhere, we can bring it back to us.


Ash: Right.


Cody: That sounds like what it is. That's what we do.


Ash: Interesting.


Cody: Right?


Alan: And Cody looks at the rest of the group and is like,


Cody: Sounds familiar to me.


Zan: [I dunno noise]
Max: Hmm.


Zan: Not too familiar.


Ash: Interesting. Interesting.


Oliver: And she's like holding your wrist and turning the wrist band over and looking at it. She's like,


Ash: Oh, there's this symbol on here.


Cody: Can I have my arm back, please?


Alan: And Cody is kind of tugging ever so slightly.


Ash: Okay, whatever.


Jasmin: Um. Sorry to... You're welcome to examine stuff I– I guess? But doesn't Erica's still need get blessed?


Erica: I sure do.


Jack: Oh yeah. OK, Erica, come on. Your turn.


Oliver: And Jack grabs your hands and pulls you over to the center of the room and Ash shuffles you all back out of the way so you're not blocking the mirrors. And Jack does her blessing again. And the moonlight flares. And as it hits you, Erica, it is blinding for a moment. All you see is white. You blink a few times and the light clears and you can see again that everything is much more vibrant than before. You can see into the dark alcoves in the hallways leading off this room as though you were in full daylight. And everything has a slight pink tint to it. You reach up to your face and you can feel a pair of sunglasses there.


Zan: Nice shades.


Oliver: When you look down, you can read the ruins on the floor and they say, "a blessing bestowed upon the quiet observer. Moon shades to bring clarity in dark times."


Erica: Whoa! I can read.


Oliver: Ash is like, jotting down her notes and like looking at the floor at the runes. And she's like,


Ash: OK. So I think these glasses.. let's see... Moonshades. Something, something, darkness. Should let you see in the dark. Might have other clarifying benefits as well. Sounds a little cryptic.


Oliver: In game mechanics, you now have 60 feet of dark vision when you're wearing these glasses and... You can read the runes on the floor.


Allison: Hell, yeah. Erica kind of pulls them off her face and looks at them and says,


Erica: Very "la vie en rose."


Oliver: You can also all like, pick what your things look like. Like I gave you like a basic description but you are welcome to clarify.


Robot: Allison, I need you to describe to me what kind of shades these are.


Alice: Please do.


Talia: Are they like, aviator's?


Allison: Ummmmmmm. I'm thinking like some Ray-Bans, you know?


Robot: Yes. Thank you.


Oliver: Hell yeah.


Cody: You look real cool, Erica. I like them.


Erica: Thanks, buddy.


Allison: And Erica does some finger guns.


Alan: Cody finger guns right back, but not as well refined. A little bit sloppy.


[Laughter.]
Talia: How do you do sloppy finger guns?


Oliver: Just kinda points? I just held up my arms to do it. It's great.


Alan: Twelve year olds just get excited and the hands are a bit floppy and just–.


Talia: Everything's a little floppy.


Oliver: So Ash finishes writing in her notebook and then snaps it shut and turns to address all of you.


Ash: All right. OK, Blessing's done. Thank you all for your service. May the moon's light guide you, yada, yada, yada. I'm tired. Listen, I know we didn't get off to like a great start, but clearly the moons see something in you and it isn't your incredible ability to lie about where you're from or why you're here. So if you're interested, I've got more jobs for you. I can help you not be so fucking obvious about whatever it is you've got going on. But now I need to go sleep.


Zan: [Exaggerated lying voice] I don't know what you're talking about.


Ash: Yeah, exactly. Great. Ten out of ten.


Zan: Thanks.


Ash: Come back tomorrow and we can talk.


Oliver: And with that, she turns on her heel and walks out of the room.


Zan: Bye.


Cody: Bye!


Oliver: And Jack's like,


Jack: Okay. So maybe we'll... Oh! Tallulah, do you want to do yours now?


Oliver: And Tallulah just shrugs her off and is like,


Tallulah: No, I'm good. Okay. Let's go home.


Oliver: And she leaves the tower.


Talia: We also do that.


Oliver: Jack's like,


Jack: Bye!


Zan: Bye.


Jasmin: Bye, Jack.


Cody: Bye, Jack! Nice to meet you.


Allison: Erica gives Jack finger guns as she walks out.


Oliver: She does it back, but she doesn't know what you're doing and so she does it wrong.


Allison: Perfect.


Oliver: But it's very cute.


Alice: She does it with all of her fingers extended. It's like jazz hands. But finger guns.


Oliver: Yes.


[Laughter.]


Talia: What??


Robot: We gotta teach everyone of this world how to meme.


Talia: Max's quest.


Oliver: Yeah. So Tallulah leads you back through town, back to the Rag Tag. As you approach the door you can see that there's like a scroll of paper tucked into the door handle that Tallulah picks out and unfurls and unlocks the door. And then she kind of pauses with the door ajar, staring at the paper.


Zan: What's up? Forgot to pay a bill?


Tallulah: Oh, nothing.


Oliver: And she says,


Tallulah: Thanks for today.


Oliver: And opens the door so you can come inside.


Zan: Hey, if you don't mind my asking what's your deal with the Daughters?


Tallulah: I used to be one. Not anymore. Now I run a hostel.


Cody: They seem really nice, though. Why... Why did you leave?


Tallulah: That's...


Oliver: Make a persuasion check.


Alan: Okay. That's a 5 + 4 = 9.


Oliver: Yeah. Tallulah like pinches the bridge of her nose and then rubs her eyes and is like,


Tallulah: It's... It's a long story. Yeah.


Cody: It's ok. Maybe some other time.


Tallulah: Yeah. I'm tired. I imagine you're all pretty tired. Thank you for today and... Yeah. You're all pretty good at the merc thing. A little unconventional but I like unconventional.


Oliver: And she like gives you like a half smile and she's like,


Okay, this is weird. Given what we've been through. But... do you want to stay here again tonight? And if so, can I have five silver?


Zan: Yeah, for sure.


Jasmin: Yeah, of course.


Tallulah: Okay.


Talia: I hand over my five silver.


Oliver: Thank you.


Talia: To end of the conversation.


Allison: Wow.


Talia: I will pay to go to bed right now.


Jasmin: I give Zan a silver.


Oliver: Okay, great. You all kind of shuffle money between you.


Zan: Wait. But if you give me a silver...


[Laughter.]
Zan: Oh, that's fair.


Tallulah: Okay. Cool. Do you need anything else? More blankets or whatever? I can get you a jug of water.


Oliver: She pulls a jug of water from behind the counter and gives it to you.


Talia: Have you got like, an extra pillow? So I just... Don't have to steal.


Tallulah: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just a sec.


Oliver: And she goes through a doorway and comes back with, like, a couple of blankets and two pillows on top in a stack. And she's like,


Tallulah: Here.


Zan: Oh, awesome. Thanks.


Tallulah: OK. Good night.


Oliver: And she goes to her room.


Alan: Cody's just gonna – on the way out – is just going to go up to the bar and set one of his gold–.


Allison: Get a whiskey.


Alan: Well, whatever the place where she stands usually. And is just gonna leave one of his gold pieces from his set and then just say himself,


Cody: I hope it doesn't turn into a card overnight.


Alan: And go upstairs.


Alice: Awwwww.


Oliver: That was really sweet. Okay. Yeah. You make your way upstairs to the little attic room with four bunks for you to sleep in.


Talia: I'm going to set up out on the balcony again.


Oliver: Great. Yeah. You now have plenty of, like, thick blankets and pillows to make yourself nice nest out there.


Zan: Max. I'm sleeping out here. Don't fucking step on me.


[Laughter.]


Max: Yep. Got it this time.


Oliver: Nailed it.


Jasmin: Are you sure you're comfortable? Do you need extra blankets or something to put on the wood?


Zan: Nah– I got– I got extras just to make sure that I could be comfortable out here. Don't worry about it.


Jasmin: Are you sure a single pillow will be enough?


Zan: Yeah. I can like fold up one of these–.


Jasmin: It looks really uncomfortable.


Zan: Yeah– No, I'm good.


Allison: Erica walks up to Zan and puts her hand on her shoulder and says,


Erica: Hey, Zan?


Zan: Yeah.


Allison: And then she leans in really close and she says,


Erica: Please don't throw a child on me tomorrow morning.


Zan: There is a valid request. I'll try my best.


Allison: And then Erica pats her on the back and gives her finger guns and then goes and lays down.


Zan: What is with all the finger guns??


Erica: I'm just really feeling these glasses, OK?


[Laughter.]


Zan: It's nighttime!


Oliver: Yeah. I mean, Erica has the sunglasses that make things brighter.


Talia: [Singing] I wear my sunglasses at night.


Robot: Yeah. Erica can wear sunglasses in the dark and see better than all of us.


Oliver: Yup.


Talia: [Still singing] So I can.... So I can...


Allison: Exactly.


Talia: I was hoping someone else was gonna join in. I don't know any of the other words.


Alan: Cody is going to climb up into his bunk and kind of pull all his cards checking out his new ultra shiny monkey.


Oliver: Holographic monkey card.


Alolan.


And there's gonna kind of put them away and like, just kind of in the quiet, look at the ceiling... and then bring up his spell menu and just kind of start scrolling through all the buttons because there's some new ones that he hasn't seen yet. And as he's looking through them all, one stands out to him. And it's not like because it's sounds powerful or cool or fun or anything, but he just doesn't really understand what it says. I mean, he can read the words, but like, unlike the other spells that mentioned lightning or fire or invisible forces, he's like, never heard these specific words used like they are. So he stares at the button looks around the room seeing if anyone is watching him. And he's remembering back to Jasmins warning in the growth about the explosive power of some of the spells. But this one doesn't mention damage or, you know, nothing at all. It sounds too scary.


Talia: I'm so nervous.


Allison: Is this like... Make the party horny button?


[Laughter.]


Alan: So he... He presses the button.


Talia: Everybody dies.


Alan: And... And nothing happens. The room remains just as still as it was before. And Cody's somewhat let down a little bit like, well, that was nothing. He stares at the button and sees that button has greyed-out and is replaced by a slowly filling bar across the button. And he's staring at the growing light for a couple seconds. But as he waits, you know, mixture of the day's exhaustion and the attention span of being a twelve year old, his mind drifts to home, to his room and his bed and his parents, his friends at school to his sister's laughter that always made him smile. And he slowly starts to fade off to sleep in the warmth. As his eyes close on the menu as that spell is still loading in, one last thought floats through his head.


Cody: I don't really know what this button is finding, but whatever it is, [Sigh.] I could really use something, anything, that feels familiar.


Talia: Oh my God!


Alice: Awww!


Robot: Oh, no.


Alan: And then he drifts off to sleep.


=== Start Midroll ===


Alan: Hello and welcome to Dice Disasters. This is the part of the show where we stop pretending to be other people and start pretending to be ourselves. Allison, you're here.


Allison: I'm here. Hello.


Alan: I hope you're enjoying this episode so far.


Allison: I am having such a good time. This is actually one of my favorite episodes in a lot of ways.


Alan: You got you got your cool sunglasses.


Allison: Mm hmm. Finger guns.


Alan: What would a good new layer to Erica's persona. I love it. But yeah, we're just here to say hi to everybody listening and say thank you for joining us on our crazy, kooky adventure.


Allison: We've been hitting some download milestones, which is very, very cool. And we're so grateful to everyone that is listening and downloading the podcast. So thank you so much.


Alan: Yeah, y'all are the best and super excited to tell you that earlier this episode, you heard some new music from People Need Goals.


Allison: Yes. Jack is so talented and we love this new track so much.


Alan: Yeah, I was like, we need some new music. And we went straight to Jack and they just, as always, knocked out the park. So thank you for helping make Jasmin's Moon Blessing moment so special.


Allison: If you haven't checked out People Need Goals' other music yet, please do that. They have a band camp and so much good music. Go give it a listen.


Alan: Absolutely. I have several of their tracks and EPs and stuff just to listen to and chill out too. It's amazing.


Allison: In addition to checking out Jack's music, you should also maybe share the podcast? Question mark? Yeah!


Alan: What?? I think not a question mark. I think exclamation point. Or if you want a super fancy, the interrobang.


Allison: Yes.


Alan: I love the interrobang.


Allison: This is the interrobang part of the podcast where we ask that you please continue sharing our podcast. We have lots of new NPCs coming up, which is very exciting. And because we're catching up to kind of where backlog was, you're gonna be hearing a lot more... uh, stuff from you guys. So I'm excited for you all to hear that, too. So keep sharing the podcast. Feel free to leave a review and put your name if you want to be considered for an NPC name. And yeah, just all of our growth has really been because of you guys. So thank you so much for everything that you're doing for us.


Alan: Yes. And don't forget to submit in the item ideas you have via our website, DiceDisasters. com, where you can not only submit items to Oliver for consideration, including in our story, but you can also see cast bios and see our character stats and lots of other information.


Allison: You'll also find links to all of our socials as well as an invite to our discord if you want to come hang out. We take a lot of personality quizzes and it's a good time.

Allison: Yeah.


Alan: Well, anyway, let's get back to the story and see what happens next.


Allison: Yeah. Thank you so much, guys. Enjoy what's coming up.


Alan: Thanks. Bye!


Allison: Bye.


=== End Midroll ===


Oliver: Zan, you wake up in the middle of the night, but not because you're uncomfortable. You're quite cozy in your little bed on the balcony. This time you wake up because you're being watched. As you open your eyes, you see perched on the railing above you is Peanut, the black, short haired goblin with ivy on his back and glowing purple eyes. He's watching you sleep.


Zan: You really are going to help us out.... keep us getting money for your reward, huh? We were joking. You can go back home now.


Talia: Zan opens one eye to check if the cat's still there. Goblin. If Peanut's still there.


Oliver: Peanut is still there. And he slides a paw forward, knocking a piece of paper onto your lap.


Talia: Oookay. I look at the paper.


Oliver: You turn the paper over and see an elegant poster with an illustration of a purple tent. There's a bunch of writing on it that you can't read. And when you look back up, the cat goblin is gone.


Zan: What the fuck?


Oliver: You tuck the paper into your purse and you fall back asleep.


Zan: [Incomprehensible grumbling.]


Oliver: Grumble, grumble grumble. The rest of you wake up to a gentle knocking noise on the door of your attic room. As you all kind of like groggily open your eyes, you see that it's full morning. The light is shining in through the window.


Zan: It's so bright out here!


Oliver: You hear complaints coming out of the balcony door.


Zan: The only problem with being out here.


Robot: Wait, was– did I say that Max was on a top or bottom bunk?


Oliver: Max is on a top bunk. Max and Cody are both on top bunks.


Robot: Okay.


Allison: Is Max top or bottom?


[Laughter]


Robot: Yeah, I remember that question. I couldn't remember the answer.


[Laughter.]


Robot: Max is hanging half off of the top bunk. Like one arm, one leg off, still dead asleep, snoring.


Oliver: Which of you is under Max? Erica. orJasmin?


Allison: I think it's me.


Oliver: Okay, great. How long have you been awake then?


Allison: Erica's just kind of like looking up at him disdainfully and just been... Like this is a hostel. This is what I should expect.


Oliver: Usually it's not people you come to the hostel with.


[Laughter.]


Oliver: Oh, God. One day I was staying in a hostel and the guy underneath me was snoring so loud that I like got frustrated and I pushed my arm against the wall so the bunk bed, like, tilted a little and then let go. So it slammed into the wall and he stopped snoring.


Allison: One time I stayed in a hostel and the bunk across from mine – the top bunk – the man was butt naked and he did not have a blanket on.


[Exclamations of terror.]
Allison: Yeah. So. Thank you, Ukraine. Had a great time. Just full– luckily it was the back of him. But just full back. But from head to toe guide. He was from Belarus.


Alice: For all you know, he could have been fully dressed from the front.


[Laughter.]


Allison: He's got like, a little sheath on.


Alice: It's like that suits that is a suit from the front and like underwear for your back, except it's a pyjama. Or he could have been in half a suit.


Talia: That's what I was picturing!


Oliver: He's wearing a onesie that looks like he's naked.


Robot: It's half a suit but it's just the front half.


Allison: I should note that he was also staying at the hostel with his girlfriend. They only paid for one bed. So they were both naked. In a twin on the top bunk.


Oliver: Oh, the amount of flesh sticking is– uugghh–


Talia: Noooo.


Alan: "Flesh sticking," is the worst phrase anyone's ever said on this podcast.


Oliver: All right. Good morning. Here we go.


Alice: Yes.


Talia: No! It's bad morning now.


Cody: [Yawns.]
Jasmin: Are you going to wake Max or...


Zan: Was someone knocking?


Allison: Erica looks at Jasmin and kind of like makes a disgusted face and then finger guns to her.


[Laughter.]
Allison: Like, this is your job.


Jasmin: Okay, uh...


Alice: Jasmin grabs her staff and like, king of prods at Max.


Oliver: Do you roll a check??


Robot: Uh, how hard are you prodding?


Alice: Very tentative.


Robot: I'm not up.


Oliver: Nothing happens. Still snoring. It's getting louder.


Jasmin: Well, I guess we just won't explain things to him if it's anything important.


Talia: Zan's in the room now, and she says,


Zan: Well, there's always my patented wake up method. Hey, Cody.


Allison: Erica just screams,


Erica: Max, give me 20 pushups!


Robot: Yeah! Max is going to jolt up, roll off the top bunk and onto the floor and and just automatically try to get in push up position.


Zan: Dude.


Oliver: Well, you're all awake at this point.


Alice: I'll open the door.


Oliver: You open the door and there is a tray of food like just like loaded up, sitting on the little landing there. And there is a drawing. Looks like it was made by a small child of a kid with a glowing shirt.


Erica: Hey, Cody, someone has a crush on you.


Cody: What?


Allison: I hand Cody the drawing.


Alan: Cody rubs his eyes, still kind of waking up and takes it like,


Cody: Hey, that's me.


Oliver: Yeah. Erica is you hand Cody this paper, and Cody is waking up, the blankets at the foot of his bed just start, like, writhing and moving.


Alan: And Cody is like immediately like up against the other corner. And just like,


Cody: Huh?? What?? Huh! Uh, there's something here!


Zan: Hang on.


Talia: Zan picks up her shoe.


Oliver: Yeah. You watch as a little nose peeks out from under the covers and then out crawls a bright blue otter.


Cody: Wuh? What? Uh... Wotter?


Oliver: It like, chitters and runs up and cuddles up into your lap and flops around on its back.


Cody: WHUH. How?? What! Why. How are you... here?? How did you. What're you– you look good. Uhhhhhhh. This is weird.


Robot: Max is just finishing his pushups.


Max: 19 and 20.


Robot: And then he stands up and he's like,


Max: Oh hey, there's food. Is that an otter?


Cody: Um, yeah. Oh, this is Wotter. It's one of my Codymon. And it's here.


Zan: Couldn't tell.


Cody: It's Wotter. The water otter.


Zan: Yep. Love it.


Oliver: Yeah. It's just like crawling all over Cody, like sniffing his ears and going like [otter noises]
Cody: Hey, hey, hey. High five.


Oliver: Oh. Yeah. She backs up on her hind legs and slaps like her little flippery paw against your hand.


Talia: Zan looks at Hat and asks for a high five.


Oliver: Hat, doesn't give you a high five.


Talia: Dammit.


Oliver: She's asleep. She loves being asleep.


Talia: Yeah, that's fair. I also love being asleep.


Cody: Y'all didn't see this– see Wotter follow was back here last night?


Talia: Wait, is it a sea otter or a river otter?


Alan: River otter.


Talia: Is it a cute river otter or creepy river otter.


Alan: Totally cute.


Talia: Okay.


Alan: With blue fur and a green tummy and white paws. Yes. Super cute. Big eyes.


Talia: [Talia melting noises.] Aaawwwwwww!


Alice: Adorable!


Cody: I don't know how.–Oh, wait. Ummm. I might have cast a spell last night.


Oliver: Ooopsie whoopsie!


Zan: In your sleep?


Jasmin: Was the spell... was spell create adorable creature?


Cody: Well, OK. Totally honest here. Didn't know what it did when I pressed the button.


Zan: Always good.


Jasmin: Cody.


Zan: Good plan.


Cody: It didn't say like damage or anything dangerous. It was called find familiar. And I was like, sounds fine... And I pressed it. And now I have an otter.


Zan: I mean, it's like a magic pet, right? That's what a familiar is.


Cody: Is that what a familiar is? I didn't know what it meant. Wotter, are you... Are you gonna be good? Are you cool? Are you like housetrained and stuff?


Zan: God I hope so.


Oliver: Wotter rolls over and goes [otter chittering noises]
Zan: [Gasps.]
Jasmin: [Giggles.]
Zan: She's so cute.


Alan: Cody just rubs her tummy.


Oliver: Yes. She bleps her tongue.


[Talia and Alice screaming.]


Cody: I think we're good. I think– don't panic. We just... We have an otter now, and it's fine. Wotter, can you get on my shoulder? That would be nice.


Oliver: She does. She had pretty heavy. She's not tiny. So you have to, like, crouch a little under the weight.


Cody: Uhhhh, OK. How about you just run next to me. This would be better.


Oliver: She goes and sits on the and of your bed.


Cody: OK, cool. OK. Food. I'm hungry.


Jasmin: Yes. I was about to suggest maybe you could do this over breakfast.


Cody: Yeah.


Alan: So I'll eat.


Oliver: Great. You all have some breakfast. You can hear the sounds of the town in full swing out the window from the balcony. Seems like a nice day out.


Allison: As everyone sitting down,Eerica wants to clear her throat a bit and say,


Erica: So. I feel like we should talk.


Zan: Hm?


Jasmin: About.


Erica: We've been kind of having, you know, adventures and getting pets and– and sunglasses.


Allison: Erica does the finger guns again.


Erica: And and all these things, but, uh, we still are like... Really far from home and we don't really have a plan on getting back. And I'm gonna be honest, I'm feeling a little freaked out. Like what– what... What's next? What are we supposed to do?


Zan: I mean, we gotta find the– the CASTR... Thing. Right? With the box. It said it would send us home.


Erica: Yeah, I guess– I am... I just... Ah. Do we take more jobs to get, like, money so that we can, like, find it easier? Do we go to the capital and find "The Hunter" who still kinda sounds like a villain a little bit to me. Just a wild name. Um.


Zan: [Whispering.] I think it sounds like a cool name but OK.


Jasmin: Well, the daughters offered to teach us things? Ways to survive here... and stuff. Kind of seems like a good idea. It's all really dangerous.


Erica: I guess what I want to know is, are you guys feeling like we're gonna be here for weeks or like months or– or what? You know?


Zan: I don't know. I don't– I don't even– like, we barely have enough knowledge to know how far things are away from us. How long it's going to take us to get places, much less how to get there.


Cody: I... I want to go home. I miss... I miss home a lot. So I think as long as we keep going for that, we're good. But in order to get that, we have to learn a whole lot. We don't know this place. And like, I'm glad we have each other and that we're friends. But having more friends who know more things might be good.


Jasmin: Especially if we end up going to different places. It sounded like the Daughters are everywhere? And if we if we know the daughters, then that would at least give us something familiar, even if we end up in some sort of weird fantasy land.


Erica: Yeah, that– that seems fair. And maybe...


Allison: And Erica looks around and says,


Erica: You know, right now we're two out of five in armor. Maybe– maybe that's the next goal. Sorry, I was just feeling all a little freaked out because I feel like there's still a lot of things we don't know. And I wasn't sure where everyone's head was at.


Cody: Mine's on my shoulders.


Zan: Nice.


Max: Sometimes people tell me mine's up my ass. But I... I think mine's on my shoulders.


Oliver: The boys are very helpful.


Zan: I'm really hoping you're joking, Max... But I can't tell.


Max: What?


Jasmin: I don't think Max can tell either.


Zan: Oh, boy.


Cody: What are we doing today?


Jasmin: I'd like to talk to the daughters.


Erica: Yeah. I think getting some more work... I mean, right now we don't have very much money. So maybe going back to the Daughters and talking to them would be a good idea.


Zan: Ash said that she would talk to us in the morning.


Jasmin: And also, they have information. We don't know anything. I thought maybe I could go there and spend a day reading history or something.


Zan: I mean, I don't know if you can.


Jasmin: Oh, right. I don't know what to do if I can't read. It's like all I do. Except Animal Crossing.


Allison: Erica pulls the map that Jack gave her out of her backpack and she wants to look at that and see if she can read what's written.


Yeah! So you pull out the poster tube with the map of the region that Jack lent to you that she might want back. But yeah, you unfurl the map and with your moon shades on, you can read all of the writing on the map and you can see that there are little notes about like, grey flowers found here, circled and like like handwritten on top of the map. But you can also see, like Fell's Keep is labeled and some like towns on the outskirts of the map are labeled. And there's a river that's labeled. And like all of these places, you can just read the writing.


Erica: So, great news about the reading. With these on not only do I look very cool–.


Allison: Erica does the finger guns again.


[Laughter.]


Erica: But also, I can read.


Allison: And then she kind of does jazz hands like, "You guys excited?"


Jasmin: Oh, um–.


Zan: You need to call me your hands down a little bit.


Erica: Don't police me, Zan.


Zan: All right.


Jasmin: Can I read with them?


Allison: Erica passes them to Jasmin to try on.


Oliver: Jasmin, you put these glasses on and the room gets like a little dimmer and pinker and you look at the map and it looks the same.


Jasmin: No, it doesn't work.


Max: You look rad, though.


Jasmin: Thanks. Uh.


Alice: Jasmin kind of looks at her hands and then forms them into finger guns and points them at Max.


Robot: Max gives Jasmin some A+ plus finger guns.


Oliver: Yes. So for all of your items that you got, they are all "atuned" to you. So in D&D that basically means that the magical effects only work for you.


Erica: So seems like it's just me, but maybe we can work together and figure out some more information because I still feel a little wary about how fascinated Ash is with every aspect of our being.


Jasmin: Yeah.


Erica: But this will let us do things in secret a little bit more.


Jasmin: You can read and I can take notes?


Erica: That sounds good.


Zan: Can you read this poster thing?


Talia: Zan pulls out the thing that Peanut gave her.


Oliver: Erica, Zan hands you a poster. That's like an ornately painted illustration of like a little purple tent. And across the top it says Trinket's Trinkets. And then around the sides, it says, like, "buy shiny things," "all shiny stuff," "love to sell shiny things to you." "Shiny for money!" "Buttons!" "Gems!".


Robot: Oh, no.


Oliver: "Little things!" "Shiny."


Allison: Erica looks at Zan kind of weirdly without reading it out loud at first. Like,


Erica: [Slowly.] Where did you get this?


Zan: Cat.


[Laughter.]


Jasmin: What?


Zan: It was the cat. Peanut? Walnut? One of those.


Jasmin: Peanut?


Max: A cat gave you a poster?


Zan: Yeah, I don't know. Is that– maybe that's normal for cats in here– this world?


Max: Man, the cats here are smart.


Allison: Erica's eyes narrow. And then she reads the whole poster out loud.


Zan: Amazing.


Jasmin: Well, I. I mean, it's... As far as things that cats bring you goes, this is better than like, the bottom half of a frog.


Zan: Yeah.


[Laughter.]


Alan: I need to keep a list of things of the order of things that are cool. And right now it has two things on it. A poster about trinkets and bottom half of a frog. And as we go onto the podcast, we'll continue this list of everything in the order of which they are cool.


Oliver: Yeah.


Talia: Where do finger guns fall?


Alice: Below frogs?


Allison: They're at the very top.


Alan: Cody is going to quickly jump up to his top bunk and grab his backpack and come down and rummage through it and pull out his notebook and pull out some papers and go,


Cady: Jasmin, if you're you want something to read, I have this stuff that Lili gave me? Lili gave me notes and I don't know what to do with them. And you know plants? So maybe this will help you learn things?


Jasmin: Oh! It's... Yeah. Wow. There's a lot in here. I mean, I can't read it.


Cody: Oh.


Jasmin: Lili gave this to you?


Cody: Yeah. Yeah. I just... I'd asked her for some more medicine, before we left, and she didn't have any more, but she gave me this. And I...


Zan: So, you like, eat it?


Cody: I don't know. I just. You were just looking for things to read, and maybe... Maybe with Erica's help you can learn something.


Erica: Yeah. Maybe we can transcribe these. I mean, I know how to write how so guys can read it. So maybe over time I can like transcribe these so you can have them available to you.


Alan: Cody smiles real big, realizing that you actually did a little bit of helpful something.


Alice: Jasmin smiles and hugs Cody.


Cody: Oh, look, it's nothing. It's just I don't know. Tell me there's something cool in there if you learn any fun facts. I want– I would I would like to know them.


Jasmin: Not only will I tell you, maybe I can make some of these for you.


Cody: OK.


Max: All right. Well, now that we've eaten. What's everyone doing today? Cause I heard training from the daughters and that sounds like a workout. So that's where I'm going.


Zan: I mean, like a cat gave me, like, a magical piece of paper poster thing. So I feel like I kind of gotta?


Jasmin: Why don't we all go to that magic piece of thing before we do anything else?


Zan: [Quietyl chanting] Cat. Magic cat.


Alan: Cody holds up as two gold pieces.


Cody: I got money. Let's go.


Oliver: OK, great. So all of you make your way downstairs and you see Tallulah. Still looking kind of tired. She has her apron on and is behind the counter.


Tallulah: 'Morning.


Oliver: And kind of waves at you as you exit out the front of the shop.


Cody: Morning!


Oliver: And make your way into town. The Rag Tag is like a block or two off of like the main street. And so you wander your way over towards like the market and where all the shops are that you saw the past couple days. And you can see that the market is in full swing. People are bustling around, buying food, and doing various jobs. You pass a shoe repair place with a long line of people and what looks like a blacksmith with heat pouring out of ovens and clanging metal. And as you're like walking and squeezing your way through good crowds of people, Zan, you feel that tingling sensation on the back of your neck that you felt yesterday in the woods when a rip in space opened up in front of you.


Talia: Zan whips around wildly looking in every direction. Trying to see.


Oliver: Make a perception check.


Talia: Yeah! Roll some dice! 17 + 2 = 19.


Oliver: Nice. Yeah. You turn and you scan the market stalls and then you see it. A hut made of purple cloth nestled in between two other booths. People seem to just be like kind of ignoring it. And as you like, whipped your head around really fast to look, you see, Peanut is sitting at the opening, grooming one of his paws.


Robot: Max looks at Zan whipping her head around and is like,


Max: Are you OK?


Zan: Magic cat!


Max: What?


Zan: Magic cat.


Oliver: Yeah. You guys look and there is a purple tent that you didn't see beofre. You don't see the cat, though. I guess he ran off somewhere.


Talia: [Nervous] But do I still see the cat?


Oliver: No. You don't see the cat either. Don't worry. It's not an imaginary Zan cat.


[Laughter.]


Talia: [Relieved.] Oh my god.


Alice: I can think of worse things.


Allison: Zan is losing her mind.


Talia: The real Peanut's been inside me all along.


Oliver: You make your way over, and for the most part, people seem to be just avoiding this booth. And it's like all closed in. It's like a little bit bigger than like a booth at a farmer's market. But just like this, like thick purple cloth on all sides and the ceiling and the roof of it. And there is a sign that looks hand painted in silver paint. Erica, you see that it says, Trinket's Trinkets.


Allison: Erica walks into the tent.


Talia: We go inside.


Oliver: So, yeah. You all push through this cloth opening into a pretty large, but extremely cluttered shop. There are trinkets everywhere. There are like wind chimes and shells and crystals. And it is dark and kind of musty. It's just packed with stuff. You find like weird little boxes made of teeth–.


Talia: Nice!


Oliver: And bundles of shiny sticks that kind of wriggle when you get close to them–.


Cody: Whuhhh.


Oliver: And there's like glittering pebbles floating in glass vials. There's a stuffed crow head the size of a person's head And it's balanced on top of this like heap of rags on the corner.


Zan: That's creepy.


Oliver: There's a velvet tray covered in necklaces and bracelets of every shape and size and color. There's no one in here.


Alan: Cody is slowly reaching for the jar of floating pebbles.


Oliver: Yeah, you pick it up and as you like, tilt the jar the pebbles stay in the same place.


Cody: Whoa.


Alan: He's going to shake it a little bit.


Oliver: Yeah, you shake it and the pebbles move with it. They're just like weirdly detached and floating in there.


Cody: This is some wild stuff. What is this place?


Talia: I look around. Is there anybody else in here?


Oliver: Make an investigation check.


Alice: I will also look around.


Oliver: Or a perception check? OK? Yeah. Both of you make perception checks.


Talia: That's a 18.


Alice: Yeah. Mine is not an 18. Mine is in fact very much not 18. Because it is 7.


Oliver: The two of you kind of like split up and like wander around a little bit and you make your way back to the front of the shop and you didn't find anybody. But the crow's head turns to look at you.


Zan: [Small noise.]
Oliver: And then that whole, like, bundle of what looks like rags, kind of like jumps up and shakes itself out, revealing a small person with a crow's head bundled up in like a big coat with scarves, and it hops up on a stack of crates. Looks down at you all for a moment.


Trinket: Hello, hello. Hello weary travelers. Welcome to my little shop of trinkets. What fine shiny items might you be looking for?


Jasmin: Oh–.


Max: What?


Jasmin: Uh. Hi.


Trinket: Hello!


Zan: Hi!


Trinket: Hi! Welcome to Trinket's Trinkets. I'm Trinket. Any pronouns. This is my shop! I sell many shiny things from all over the world.


Zan: Hey, uh. How did you get the cat to bring the thing– the paper– to me?


Trinket: Oh. Sometimes the little kitty does helpful errands for Trinket. Trinkets is friends with little kitty, who's sometimes not a kitty.


Erica: Do you pay him?


Trinket: Uhhh. We trade information.


Zan: So– wait– go back like one sentence. Sometimes not a–.


Trinket: I'm Trinket!


Zan: Hi–


Trinket: Welcome to Trinket's Trinkets.


Zan: Yes–.


Trinket: Would you like to buy any trinkets?


[Laughter.]
Zan: [Exasperated.] Okay.


Trinket: Yes. I exchange trinkets for money. I like the coins. I like the platinum ones the best. They're very shiny.


Zan: Oh, we don't have those.


Trinket: OK. If you give me 10 gold, I could trade it for platinum. Yum yum yum.


Erica: Do you buy trinkets too?


Zan: Wait– do you eat them?


Trinket: Sometimes. Depends on trinket. I like the gold coins and the platinum coins the most. So I usually [sigh] can part with some some of those for very shiny trinkets.


Zan: What trinkets do you have?


Trinket: Ah! Many trinkets!


Oliver: And Trinket hops around the shop showing you a bunch of stuff. And if you all go to your character sheets, you have a tab called "trinkets."


Robot: Oh.


Talia: [Excitedly.] Jar of bees.


Oliver: This is just a short list. Also, just like as a note, this is like a reasonably sized city. So if you want anything from the 5e normal item list, you can get that from shops and stuff. So if, I don't know, if you want to buy some fucking like, rope or sticks, you can also go buy that.


[Players laughing as they read the list.]


Talia: I'm feeling like one of these is aimed at me. Very specifically.


Robot: Um. Yeah. Uh, yeah.


Oliver: So I can kind of read over some of these. There's a jar of bees. There's a grow potion which will enlarge you for 1d4 hours. There is mystery powder that when you throw it on somebody, you use the wild magic surge table to decide what happens. Oh there's one called a racing stripe cloak, which I got from snickelsox on Twitter, you get an extra 10 feet of movement in combat, but only if you make cool racecar sounds.


[Laughter.]
Alice: Nyoom.


Oliver: Exactly. Yeah. Oh, and then there's the collar of immortality. This collar fits one willing tiny creature with intelligence less than 10. When it's affixed to the creature the creature is immune to all damage, aging and hunger.


Allison: What's wild to me is that at the end of the collar of immortality–.


Talia: RIGHT?


Allison: It's like, the color can be removed by the creature deciding it has lived for a long enough.


[Laughter.]
Talia: That's– really wild. Time to die now!


Oliver: I did that vecause they needed a way to take it off.


Allison: That's the emotional last episode of Dice Disasters.


[Laughter.]
Alice: After we finally made it into the good place.


Talia: Hey, is Cody a tiny creature?


Oliver: Cody is not a tiny creature, unfortunately.


Alice: I beg to differ. But, yes.


Robot: Cody is also the highest intelligence person in our party.


Alan: Also too smart.


Talia: Yeah. All right. Never mind.


Allison: Also, this is a funny question for Zan to ask because Cody is like the same size as Zan.


[Laughter.]
Oliver: Yup!


Talia: Hey. Hey. Fuck off.


Alice: I really love the bear stick, but there's no way we can afford it!


Talia: Bear stick!


Oliver: The beer stick we actually got through the item submission form on our website. Somebody found it on a Tumblr by fizzityuck. It is a wand engraved with a picture of a bear and once per day you can use it to transport a bear to a point within range of you. it's just a regular bear. It's notnot going to fight for you or against you. Just a bear.


Alan: Oh, man. That's awesome.


Alice: Honestly, there's no way we could afford most of these things, but mostly the bear stick is amazing.


Oliver: Yeah. This is me asking all of you, do you want to be able to afford a bunch of stuff or do you want to look at stuff and then go get money and come back and buy things. So you might have to come back or pool your money together.


Talia: I have a question about the mimic ring.


Oliver: Yeah. Trinket comes over and sees you looking at a ring. All of the items have little like handwritten signs next to them. So, I'm going to say that Erica is just like reading the signs for you if you ask her to.


Allison: Yep.


Zan: You don't transform into an inanimate object, do you?


Oliver: Trinket, hops over to you and bends down and it's like,


Trinket: Mimic ring! I like this one. Shiny. Has little teeth. Yum yum yum.


Zan: Because I like being animate.


Trinket: Oh. Yes. It makes you look like inanimate objects, but you're not– your brain not goo. Or wood.


Zan: Oh, excellent.


Trinket: Yes. Your brain stay somewhere. Who knows where.


Zan: Who knows. Max's is in his butt.


Allison: But in the background, you hear Erica reading to Max and says,


Erica: These scissors, they cost 200 gold, but you can cut through time and you can just time travel with these. But it's 200 gold.


Max: Whoa!


Erica: So I don't think we can afford them. But like, these are ones to keep an eye on.


Oliver: Trinket says,


Trinket: Oh, be careful with those! Very sharp.


Alan: Cody is going to look down at his hands. He sees he has two and a half gold, and looks around, and he realizes that can only afford the jar of bees, which he's not really excited about. Because, you know, bees– just can't control that. So he looks around and he looks over at his friends and he goes,


Cody: Hey, Max. Max, come here for a second.


Max: Yeah?


Cody: If we go in together, you could get a grow potion. And one of us could get really, really big. You want to do this?


Max: Oh, that sounds really cool.


Cody: I mean, sick gains, right?


[Laughter.]


Robot: God!


Cody: You wanna?


Max: Does it just let one of us do it?


Cody: I mean, we could each take half and see if we grew a little bit.


Talia: [Quietly.] I don't think that's how that works.


Max: OK. Let's do it.


Cody: OK.


Alan: Cody and Max walk up together holding up coins saying,


Cody: One grow potion, please.


Trinket: Yay! I love coins. Thank you. Shiny, shiny.


Oliver: And Trinket picks them up– and they pick up one of the coins and then like clack their beak on it. Like,


Trinket: [nom nom nom noises.] Yes. Good. OK.


Oliver: They scoop up three of your gold coins and then hand you a grow potion, which is a little vial with some like gray silvery liquid floating in it. And it says, according to Erica, "one grow potion" on the outside.


Allison: Erica holds up her phone and her destroyed charger and says,


Erica: Do you want these?


Trinket: What is this??


Oliver: Trinket immediately picks them up and is like,


Trinket: Oh, my goodness. So bubbly, such shiny metal. Why would they make this? I love it.


Oliver: And then clacks it in their beak a couple times.


Trinket: [Clack clack clack clack.] Ooh, very hard. I like it. Where could I put this... I could put it over here–.


Oliver: And they let go and they put it on the shelf and they're like,


Trinket: Hmm, no, ok, I could put that over here. Ooh. Yes, I think this could work.


Erica: Okay. Okay but I was thinking for coin? For coins?


Trinket: Ohh for coin. OK, how many coin? How many coin for shiny. How many coins do you want for a shiny?


Jasmin: Twenty.


Trinket: Oh, too many! Too many coin.


Oliver: And they give it back and puts it in your hands. And is like,


Trinket: No.


Erica: What about ten?


Trinket: OK!


Oliver: Trinket hops away and comes back with a handful of gold and silver and copper coins and dumps them into your hands. And is like,


Trinket: I want shiny. Thank you. OK.


Oliver: And they go and they put it on the shelf that they picked out for it.


Jasmin: Do you...Only like shiny things?


Trinket: Yes.


Jasmin: Oh, okay.


Trinket: Shiny things good. Or birdseed. But I can buy that.


[Laughter]
Trinket: Or find it in the woods.


Jasmin: That's okay.


Alice: I actually have something I want to do here.


Oliver: All right.


Alice: Probably... If Trinket is looking at someone else.


Oliver: Okay...


Alice: I want to see if I can... I want to see if I can scan a bee.


Oliver: A bee??


Talia?: A bee?! I thought you were gonna scan Trinket!


[Laughter.]


Alice: I want to see if I can scan the bees!


Oliver: OK. Make a sleight of hand check.


Alice: I want to scan the bees. [Rolls.] That's a minus one.


Oliver: Sorry what?!


Talia: Total?!


Alice: [Laughter]


Talia: Are you going to release bees in here?


Alice: I have a minus four to sleight of hand and I rolled a three.


Talia: Oh my god!


Robot: OH NO.


[Laughter and screaming.]


Talia: We all die and we can never buy anything ever again.


Oliver: [Dying of laughter.] Okay. I'm sorry, Jasmin. When you go to try to scan the bees, you fuckin' punch the jar and it falls and it slams on the ground and you release a swarm of bees!


Talia: No, I wanted to buy those!


Cody: Aaah!


Oliver: It's okay. It is a giant display of many swarms of bees.


Talia: Oh, okay good.


Allison: Do the bees attack just Jasmin or all of us?


Oliver: They are are centered on Jasmin. And so... you take three damage, an did you get stung by a bunch of bees.


[Laughter.]
Alice: Jasmin screams.


Zan: Shit! Oh, god. What-- jesus-- are you-- shit. What did you do?


Oliver: Trinket hops over and it's like,


Trinket: Oh, no, my bees!


Alan: Cody casts sleep on the bees.


Oliver: Okay.


Talia: Whyyy?????


Oliver: Okay. How does sleep work?


Alan: I roll 5d8 and then if their hit points are below the 5d8--.


Talia: They're BEES.


Alan: They fall asleep.


Alice: I am also in that area. You're probably also going to make me fall asleep. But go for it. That's wonderful.


Alan: Can I spell sculpt it?


Oliver: Yes. Cody has spell sculpting.


Alan: Sorry. Sorry, Jasmin, I don't want to knock you out.


Oliver: It affects them in ascending order of current HP. So the bees definitely have fewer hit points than you do.


Talia: How many hit points to the bees have?


Oliver: Well how much did you roll, Cody? Oh, by the way, you all took a long rest, so you all have all of your spell spots and hit points back.


Talia: [Singing.] Spell slots~


Alan: Thirty hit points.


Oliver: OK. Yeah. Trinket's like,


Trinket: Ah! My bees! Oh no!


Oliver: And then you watch as all of the bees just go like, [Oliver makes the sound of small objects hitting the ground in rapid succession.] and all of them fall on the ground.


Talia: What was the best sound effect I've ever heard.


Oliver: Thank you.


Allison: Erica leans over to Max and says,


Erica: The bees are dying at an alarming rate.


[Laughter.]


Talia: You know, according to all known lots of aviation, bees–


Robot: Oh no.


Trinket: You killed my bees!


Alan: Cody runs over to Jasmin and yells to Trinket.


Cody: They're not– they're just asleep! Jasmin– are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?


Alice: Jasmin. Like, I imagine she had like her face in her hands and then removes the hands and she looks like an animal crossing character that got stung by bees.


Oliver: Oh, no! Shes all lumpy!


Zan: Ooh– Yikes. Yikes, dude.


Jasmin: Oh no.


Oliver: Trinket scoops up the bees and puts them in a new jar and says like,


Oliver: [Softly] Ooh, are you guys OK? Yeah, you're okay. They can sting many times. They are special bees. They are all fine. They're sleeping.


Jasmin: That's great.


Zan: Good to know. Hey, can I buy some.


Trinket: Yeah. Okay. Do you want used bees?


[Laughter.]


Cody: They'll only be asleep for one more minute.


Zan: No, I'll take some fresh ones just in case they got like–.


Trinket: Oh, you're gonna take the used bees because you broke it.


Zan: I-- I didn'–.


Trinket: Five silver pieces, please.


Zan: Ugh, fine.


Trinket: Bees are fine. They're resilient. They actually are immortal bees. Shh, don't tell! Trinket does crimes.


[Laughter.]
Talia: [Immitating Trinket.] Trinket does death crimes!


Allison: Each bee has a tiny collar of immortality.


Alan: That is our first t-shirt. Trinket does crime.


Trinket: The bees only die when they decide to die.


Alice: [Immitating Trinket.] Don't tell! Trinket does crime!


Talia: Don't tell! Okay, I pay, uh–.


Trinket: Ooh, silver pieces. I like silver pieces. Thank you.


Allison: Erica is also gonna buy the Mimic Ring.


Oliver: Oh, nice. All right.


Talia: You got that dough now.


Oliver: Yeah. Trinket goes and gets you the mimic Ming and brings it to you. And it's got like a kind of looks like a mouth on the front, like a shiny pointy mouth. And shes like,


Trinket: Here you go! Be careful.


Erica: Thank you.


Trinket: I don't know if it will turn back into mimic.


Alan: Cody goes to hand the grow potion to Max.


Cody: Hey, why don't you put this in your bag? You can you hold on to it.


Max: Well, I don't... I don't have a bag.


Cody: Oh, you don't?


Zan: Typical man.


Cody: You need a bag. Go buy a bag.


Zan: Get a purse. Get over yourself.


Max: Oh. OK. I dunno why you're yelling at me. I don't like it.


Talia: Zan was woken up by "maybe not a cat" last night. So. She's a little grumpy.


Cody: Sorry. Just... I don't want to hold the potion. If I accidently just get thirsty, I might drink it by accident. So I want you to have it. Okay, fine. I'll keep on to it until you have a bag. Is that okay?


Max: Yeah. I.. Hey. Hey, hey. Trinket.


Trinket: Yes.


Max: Is there like a place I can buy a bag in town?


Trinket: I don't know. I don't know this town. I show up and they sell things and then I go away. I don't go outside here. Too many people.


Max: [Skeptical.] Okay.


Trinket: Not enough shiny things. People come here if they want to buy my shiny things. They give me coins and then I keep those coins.


Max: Okay.


Trinket: Do you want the shiny bag? This one only two hundred gold pieces. Lets you put as many things in it as you want.


Oliver: She holds up a very shiny iridescent bag. It's very cute.


Max: Well I... I do like this bag.


Trinket: Well give me two hundred gold pieces.


Max: I don't...


Robot: I look at Cody.


Trinket: Well then what are we even doing?


Robot: I look at Cody, like,


Max: I don't have 200, right?


Trinket: Okay. Is very nice to meet all of you.


Max: Okay. Bye.


Zan: Hey, real quick just, again, that's not a cat? Sometimes a cat?


Trinket: I don't know.


Zan: Just thought I'd ask.


Trinket: Sometimes it comes back different animal. Don't care.


Zan: Like what?


Alan: Goblin? Are we worrying about goblin/cat.


Oliver: Yeah, Trinket doesn't seem to care that you said cat.


Talia: What??


Alan: Oh, that's Alan's mind being a little bit blown.


Talia: Gonna write that down.


Alice: By the way, I just spent a Balm of the Summer Court to heal my bee stings.


Oliver: Okay. Yeah. You look back in Jasmin's face is agai smooth and beautiful and. She has flowers in her hair.


Zan: Where do those flowers keep coming from?


Jasmin: I make them.


Talia: Like you had them and, like Cody had them.


Jasmin: Yeah, because I healed Cody.


Zan: You've healed me though?


Jasmin: Yeah. You've had flowers in your hair. It looked really nice.


Zan: I had flowers in my hair??


Max: Yeah. You didn't notice?


Cody: Yeah.


Zan: Dammit.


Cody: You said your hair was itchy. You didn't notice the flowers?


Zan: No...


Cody: Oh.


Zan: Did it make me look dumb?


Jasmin: No. You looked really nice!


Zan: In like a cool way?


Max: I think Tallulah was kind of into it.


Oliver: Yeah. Trinkets sees Zan kind of like shyly touching her own hair in memory of the flowers and is like,


Trinket: Oh, shiny bracelet. Can I touch it?


Zan: Yes?


Oliver: She comes over and she's like crouching on a crate next to you and just starts pulling at your wrist and touching the bracelet and being like,


Trinket: Ooh, shiny! Does it come off?


Zan: Nope.


Trinket: That's dumb. Why did you do that?


Zan: Didn't.


Trinket: I mean, I guess you have shiny thing forever, but I want it now. Can I have it?


Zan: Don't think so.


Trinket: How much for shiny bracelet? I could take your hand off and get the bracelet off and put the hand back.


Max: You can... You can put the hand back?


Trinket: Yeah. Just put the hand back. Well, maybe feel a little weird.


Zan: How functional would the hand be?


Trinket: Probably 86 percent.


Zan: Yeah I like that extra 14 percent. I'll keep it on. Thanks.


Trinket: OK. Well if you change your mind, come back.


Zan: Do you know anything about it?


Trinket: Does it do anything?


Zan: Okay. You don't know anything about it. Nope. Doesn't do anything. Just shiny.


Trinket: Okay. Liar. Bye.


Zan: Bye.


[Laughter.]


Zan: I have bees now.


Cody: Are we leaving?


Jasmin: Yeah, I think we are. I think we're leaving.


Cody: Great. Thanks, Trinket. Bye!


Trinket: Okay. Bye bye. Come back if you have shiny things. I might not be here though. Okay. Bye.


Cody: Where-- Where are you going to go? Okay. Bye.


Talia: Only shows up at night around certain villages.


Oliver: Yeah. You, you wander back at and you kind of have to like blink as your eyes readjust to like normal sunlight. It was very dark in that tent.


Talia: Zan puts on her sunglasses that she just remembers that she had because she was looking in her purse.


Oliver: Zan also looks cool. Erica, the world looks the same to you.


Allison: Sure does.


Robot: Max is just going to ask random people where he can buy a bag until he finds someone that has an answer.


[Laughter.]
Oliver: Okay. Make a perception check.


Robot: 14.


Oliver: Okay, yeah. You walk up to like two old men with interesting horns coming out of their heads and they're like sitting at a little table playing some sort of board game. And they look up as you come over and they're like,


Old man: Hello there, son. What can I do for you today?


Max: Hi. Do you know where I could buy, like, a bag to put all my stuff in?


Old man: Oh, yeah. You should go down to Terry's. He makes all sorts of fine leather equipment. He's quite a ways down the road...


Oliver: And he turns and points to a shop that is about like 40 feet away.


Old man: Just go in there and ask for whatever you need from Terry. He's a nice guy. Anyway...


Max: Okay–.


Old man: Fine weather we're having, isn't it?


Max:  Oh, yes. It's.. It's very nice... Out... Today.


Old man: Yeah.


Max: I'll–.


Old man: What a fun day to spend in the sunshine.


Max: Yep. I'll just. I'll be going to Terry's now.


Old man: Oh–.


Max: Okay. Bye.


Robot: And Max very quickly walks away.


Old man: Leaving already? Goodbye.


Oliver: You go to Terry's and you spend 5 silver and you get a backpack.


Talia: God.


Oliver: Congratulations. You've solved my shopping puzzle.


[Laughter.]


Oliver: Yeah. So the five of you have finished up your shopping adventure for the morning. And you make your way back over to the tower for the Daughters of the Twin Moons. You see Jack out in the front yard with that group of teenagers who you ran into the other day, and she's like excitedly explaining to them something while they're all just sitting on the grass. And she sees you approach and she like waves and then goes back to teaching.


Allison: We go inside.


Alice: Yes.


Oliver: Yeah. You kind of like wander in and you're in that big circular room, and Ash is there. And she's like bent down and like looking at the floor where you saw those runes appear the other day and she's got like a bunch of notebooks and like some like metal tools. And is like poking at the floor. And she sees you and she's like,


Ash: Oh, you came back. Oh, all right. Let's... Let's go... well, let's go up to my office to talk.


Oliver: She, like, collects her stuff, walks up some stairs, and you follow her into a medium sized office with big desk on it and bookshelves that are just like stuffed with books. You can see they're like double packed in some places. Like there's a row of books and behind it you can see there's another row of books to make more space for books. There is a large map on one wall with boards around it, with a bunch of like pieces of paper pinned to it. And there's like pins all over the map and different colors with strings connecting them. Every surface in this room, like including the desk and the chairs are just like covered in tools and journals. And what looks like weird like half finished inventions maybe. Yeah. And she like dumps her pile of stuff that she had in the moon's room onto the desk and turns to face you. And is like,


Ash: Well, I didn't I didn't actually know if you would come back, so. Okay. Hi.


Cody: Hi.


Zan: Hey.


Jasmin: Hi.


Cody: It's us again.


Ash: Yeah. Um... So. Where to start... I know you're lying. I know you're lying about everything.

Talia: I think I had a red pen leak and now it looks like there's blood all over my hands. That's fun.


Oliver: You look down and Zan has cut herself on her armor.


Talia: Ah jeez– Why is that even sharp?


Alice: It's studded leather, but it's like–.


Oliver: Spikes!


Talia: Pointy studs.


Alice: Yeah!


Robot: It's punk studs.


Talia: Did they put the studs facing the wrong direction on these? Am I wearing this inside out?


Oliver: They're facing inward.


Alice: The magic put it on inside out, accidentally.


Talia: Oh, hold on, the tags in the front! Is it supposed to be there??


Alice: Does the tag say hot topic??


Talia: It says machine wash cold. 70 percent polyester. That's not great.


Robot: Especially if it's leather armor!
