const transcript = `Oliver: You wake up on a cold, white floor. You're back in that square room with your arms splayed out around you and your face pressed against the tiles. You feel groggy again, but that's-- that's about it. You feel better. You feel rested as you look around. You see the same people you woke up with last time and a single airlock door.
=== INTRO THEME: “Elysia” by People Need Goals ===
INTERCOM: BING BONG. Calibration is 75% complete. Please proceed to testing chamber B for continued calibration.
Oliver: Max, Cody San and Jasmin, What do you do?
ZAN: UUGGHHH. Wait we did B already.
JASMIN: Maybe the B this time stands for breakfast? I'm kind of hungry.
MAX: I really hope so. I'm hungry too.
ZAN: I'm just-- I thought I had the alphabet in order here. Like I could trust that it would be in alphabetical order. But no, we went A B C D E F B. Now I don't know what's happening anymore.
CODY: Do any of y'all know what time this is gonna be over? Cause, like, I think I have to get to school at some point.
ZAN: I don't even know what time it is now.
CODY: I guess I don't have a watch.
MAX: Yeah, I think I definitely missed football practice at this point.
CODY: I have homework.
JASMIN: I have nothing.... I have nothing to do this week. So, uh, I'm probably OK.
Alan: Cody puts his wrist-things together to see if it activates. And if it does, he want to see if it has the time on it.
Oliver: It does activate. You don't see a time anywhere on it. It does say December 1st, 2019 in the corner. But that's the only date you see.
Alan: Out of memory, what was it? I can't remember. What was it last time?
Oliver: You went to bed on December 1st, 2019. And then you woke up here, and that is the last time you looked at a clock or a calendar.
ZAN: I wonder if time is passing at all.
JASMIN: Why wouldn't it be? If it wasn't? We wouldn't be able to talk, right?
ZAN: I don't know. Maybe it's like a pocket time warp space. I don't-- thing!
CODY: Hey, Good news, though, is we’ve already done B. So we know to do it this time. So we can just go do it again, I guess? And get it over with?
JASMIN: Yeah. Um I'm, um--
Alice: Oliver. Could I touch the things together and click Shield?
Oliver: Yes. So you see Jasmin bring her to wrist bands together. And when she touches them, the little menu appears and there's a button that says Equip Shield-- er, Summon Shield -- and when she does that, along her left arm sprouts up a kind of like glowing, ethereal, semi translucent shield. It’s a round shield, it kind of looks like it's covered in, like, knots and lumps, but you’ve gotta shield on one arm.
JASMIN: Um, I mean, if it's going to be this dangerous this last time, maybe we should be prepared?
ZAN: Uh, yeah, I have no problem with being prepared.
CODY: Uh… Prepared for what, though? Like, do we know what we--
ZAN: Fire. Sharks.
JASMIN: Sharks?
CODY: Oh, yeah, those. I forgot.
JASMIN: If there any sharks, you should stay behind us. Cody.
ZAN: Yes, stay behind the shield in case of sharks.
CODY: I pet a shark, at an aquarium once.
JASMIN: Oh, no, no. Um--
ZAN: What kind of shark?
CODY: It was a little a little guy in a little pool, but like--
ZAN: Was it made of metal?
CODY: I think it was made of shark.
INTERCOM: BING BONG. Please proceed to testing chamber B for calibration.
ZAN: Fine. Let's go.
JASMIN: OK? Yeah.
CODY: [Sighing.] Okay.
Oliver: Okay. You walk up to that blue ringed airlock, it door slides open. You go inside it. It slides closed behind you. This time, when it opens up, you see a long, narrow hallway. At the far end of the hallway. Is another airlock.
INTERCOM: BING BONG. Please proceed to testing chamber C for continued calibration.
Oliver: What do you do?
ZAN: Hey you, uh, still got that wrench?
MAX: Yeah. You want me to throw it again? I’m pretty good at that.
ZAN: I don't know, that’s what we did last time.
Robot: Yeah, I'll huck it down the hallway.
{5:04}
Oliver: Okay, great. The wrench goes flying down the hallway. Uh, clings and clatters and lands on a tile that sinks an inch into the floor. There's an audible click. I'd like you all to make a dexterity saving throw.
Talia: Aw, tits. Well, 10 is slightly better than nine.
Oliver: What did Max get? I'm gonna say Max is in the front since he was throwing a wrench.
Robot: Ah, 12 minus 1 = 11.
Oliver: 11. All right. Um, you do manage to jump out of the way. Behind you. Zan also ducks out of the way. Uh, Jasmin?
Alice: I rolled a 2 - 1.
Talia: Oh, no!
Oliver: Um, all right. From the other end of the hallway, a small object from whizzing towards you and slaps right into Jasmin's upper arm. You look down and you see a small metal dart sticking out of your shoulder. You take one point of damage, and I need you to make a Constitution saving throw.
Robot: Oh, no.
Talia: Wait. Didn’t she have a shield on her?
Alan: Yeah, a shield!
Oliver: Yeah, I’ll say, the shield gives her like, [sarcastically] plus seven. She still fails. She got a one, guys.
Alice: You want to know what I got for my Constitution save?
Oliver: Yeah.
Alice: I rolled a 7 - 2.
Oliver: Oh, not so Constitute this lady.
Robot: No.
Oliver: All right, Um, so your shield is probably like, I don't know, a foot and 1/2 in diameter. It's like a buckler thing on your left arm.
Alice: I didn’t have it up-- just straight up, didn’t have it-- like it was hanging by my side. I just didn’t.
Oliver: Great. Like like a human with a shield would do if they did not ever use a shield. So it hits you in the upper shoulder, and your whole left arm goes numb. You can't move it. It just, well, I guess if it was hanging there before it's still hanging there.
Alice: Yeah.
Alan: Cody had gotten a nine on that DEX safe.
Oliver: Okay, I'm going to say she was in front of you, so she took the dart.
Alan: Okay.
Alice: I did literally just tell them to stay behind me so that, uh-- Jasmin shrieks. Uh, just like a really shocked expression on her face. And stands there with her left arm just limp.
Alan: Cody walks up and kind of like, tries to make sure she's okay. Kind of like,
CODY: Uh hey, are you okay? Are you fine? Are you good?
JASMIN: Ow. What--
CODY: Uh, why didn’t you use the shield?
[Laughter]
JASMIN: I... didn't think about it.
CODY: Oh, uh, okay.
Alan: And he just king of slinks away.
INTERCOM: BING BONG. Please proceed to testing chamber C for continued calibration.
Alice: Is it possible to grab the shield with my right hand and switch it?
Oliver: Yes.
Alice: Okay, now I just have a limp arm.
Talia: Where did the dart come from?
Oliver: Make a perception check.
Talia: 19.
Oliver: All right, so on the other end of the hallway, there's one of those airlock doors and, um, you can see on the like wall beside it, there is a tiny hole at about Jasmin shoulder height, uh, and you know that the dart came out of that towards you. And since you're all the way at the other end of the hallway, with that amazing perception check, you can kind of, like, suss out the angle, and it looks like it flew straight across. So it was going pretty fast.
Talia: Also, that was a plus two. So that was a 20.
Oliver: 20. Perfect. Yes.
Talia: Zan’s going to say,
ZAN: Hey, I think we should all just kinda crawl across the floor on this one. I'm pretty sure that it can't get us if we're underneath about, oh, I don't know, Jasmin shoulder height.
Alice: So, just so you know. Jasmin is six foot three.
Talia: Oh, so we should all just duck, like, maybe a little bit.
Alan: Cody can just stand.
Talia: I can just walk, yeah.
Robot: Yeah. Cody could just walk.
Oliver: All right. Great. Um, so you all just gonna walk across the hallway now?
Talia: Yeah, maybe duck a little? I'm gonna duck like, a little bit, but not that much.
Alan: Cody, having seen a lot of these things being activated by, you know, tiles on the floor, he is going to keep a really strong eye out for, like, any tile that seems different, that might shift.
Robot: Yeah, I'm gonna attempt to do the same.
Oliver: Okay. Um, could the two of you roll a perception check?
Robot: I actually have good perception. Didn't know that.
Alan: Okay, Natural 20.
Oliver: Oh damn!
Robot: 17 + 2.
Oliver: Jesus Christ. All right, well, using your fucking eagle eyes, the two of you can see that there's a small, like a slight discoloration. Like the normal tiles are like white, and then the trigger tiles are like, kind of like an eggshell tint. Um, you all get ten out of ten on your eye exams, and I'm gonna say you'll make it down the hallway just fine between ducking and your cool, trap-seeing eyeballs. Awesome.
Talia: That was a lot of good rolls that we used up in this hallway.
Oliver: Yeah, you sure saw those tiles.
Robot: I am going to make sure I pick up the wrench on the way.
Oliver: All right. Great.
Alan: My second natural 20 on a frickin perception this game. I’ll fall down a pit with a three--
Talia: But you’ll see it!
Alan: I’ll see it real good!
Alice: Um, Jasmin goes over last, because now she's incredibly scared of it.
Oliver: Okay, great.
Alice: But she just keeps the shield covering like her face. She’s ducking behind the shield for the entire way.
Oliver: Okay, so, um yeah, you all make it to the other airlock door. Same thing. It's ringed in blue light. And when you pass into the little space, it turns red and closes, and then the door in front of you opens. This time it opens up into a big square room with an exit on the opposite side. Instead of a pit, though, this room has a 15 foot high barrier dividing it in half. So you are cut off from the side with the exit. Near the side walls, the barrier is made of those same smooth tiles, but the middle 15 feet isn't solid. Instead, the middle section of the wall is made of crackling blue electricity. What do you do?
Max: Uh, there is parts of the wall that wall that are solid, right?
Oliver: Yes.
Max: Like near the walls on the size.
Oliver: Um, about like, a two foot span.
Alice: Are any of you good at climbing?
Alan: Cody looks up it Max and just kind of looks at him pretty intently and and then goes,
CODY: Can you throw me?
MAX: Oh hell yeah I can throw you. I learned how to do this.
Robot: Um, Max is gonna give stand at like-- Well, he's gonna walk over to, like, one of the like solid parts of the wall.
Oliver: Uh huh.
Robot: And very gingerly with, like, one finger. Go poke it.
Oliver: The wall part?
Robot: Uh huh. The solid part.
Oliver: Uh, it's fine. It’s just a wall.
Talia: How high did you say the wall was?
Oliver: 15 feet.
Talia: All right.
Oliver: Just straight up. Smooth wall.
JASMIN: If you're gonna jump, I think I can help. I have something in this menu here somewhere. Uh, it says jump.
Robot: Max is gonna go up to, like, one of the one of the solid parts of the wall. And then, uh, do like a wall sit kind of thing on it. And cup his hands. And then just like motion for Cody to, like, run at him.
Oliver: Okay-- sorry--
Talia: [Nervous.] Oh-kayy--
Oliver: Okay-- Can I-- Okay. Can I have everybody make a wisdom saving throw right now? Just-- I don't know if this is normally done in Dungeons and Dragons, but--
Talia: To resist a stupid plan?
Oliver: Just... you’re just having a moment where you're gonna do a think.
Talia: I got a 19.
Alan: 16.
Talia: Do I know it's a bad plan?
Alice: 17.
Oliver: All right. Great. Across the board, you all take a moment... I bet Cody's like, poised to run towards Max. Max is in boosting position. You realize that if you throw this child upwards onto this wall, it's unlikely we'll make it 10 feet straight up. But you also realize that he'll then fall back down-- at least, even if it's on the other side, like 15 feet.
Alan: Well, I had a plan for that part. Well, not the up part. The up part was on Max, But on the down part, I had a plan for that.
Oliver: Okay, great. I'm just-- now you all know and you can do as you wish.
Alan: But, I mean, I know it's risky, but hey, D&D!
Alice: If you want, we can do one of those things were like, we all realize just too late and as we all scream “NOOO” it happens--
[Laughter]
Oliver: All right. All right. Um, uh, Max why don’t you make a strength check-- uh, how about an athletics check.
Robot: That's ah, 14.
Oliver: 14. Okay, um, with that you launch Cody up. And Cody, can you make a dexterity-- Maybe an acrobatics check?
Talia: Oh-- why are we throwing this child…
Alan: Acrobatics check?
Oliver: Yeah.
Alan: That would be a seven.
Talia: Oh no…
Olier: You watch Max, this, like big, beefy football player looking dude, just huck this tiny 12 year old with a bowl cut straight up in the air.
Talia: He's not even like an athletic kid. He’s like a nerd.
Alan: I didn't realize that I had already run at Max-- my intent was as Cody was running, he was going to press feather fall on his wristband, I think, as he was going. So it was already going when he took off.
Oliver: Sure. All right. You have feather fall on. Max chucks you up in the air and you watch him go flying and he gets, I would say, maybe up to like 12 feet up the wall, and then kind of clonks his head against it, falls backwards and slowly floats back down, into Max’s lap.
[Laughter]
Alan: Oh, I'm so happy.
Oliver: Cody, take-- no, I’ll say ou avoided all the image since you cast feather fall.
Alan: It says “takes no falling damage.” Unless it's clonking damage?
Oliver: Yeah, I was going to give you clonking damage, but I think you're ok.
Talia: Um, can I do just like a like a check around the room? To see if there's anything other than this wall and the lightning anywhere.
Oliver: Yes, um, I would say make a perception check.
Talia: Okay. Nat 20.
Oliver: All right, Let me down to where I wrote this. All right. Okay.
Talia: I’m pretty sure it's, like, a 22 because I’ve got pretty good perception.
Oliver: Beautiful. All right, so I'm gonna tell you a whole bunch of things.
Talia: Nice.
Oliver: First thing, mm, on I'm gonna go from most obvious, the least obvious.
Talia: Sounds good.
Oliver: On the floor on your side of the barrier, one of the tiles is loose. It's like sticking up at an angle, like just-- just a little bit. Like an inch or so. Um, and you can see something green poking out from under it. There's also a loose tile on the barrier wall. Not the one that Max was leaning against, but the like, mirror image on the other side of the room. And that tile is like, bent a little bit, but it's almost imperceptible. You can see that tile is bent a little bit. Yeah, I'll leave it there for now.
Talia: Okay. Can I check out-- can I like, investigate the one with the green stuff?
Oliver: Yeah. Um, so you.. I'll give you that same perception check. So you kind of like bend down and look, and so you can see underneath this tile, there is a small space. And what looks like the root of a tree, maybe? Or, like, some sort of branch is, like, pushed its way into this space and is butting up against the tile, causing it to, like, push outward from the floor. You can actually see some, like, little leaves along this branch. Um, does Zan know anything about plants?
Talia: Uh, yeah. I actually wrote it into Zan’s background that she works in a florist shop sometimes.
Oliver: Ok okay, perfect.
Talia: So whatever a casual florist employee would know.
Oliver: Right. Um..
Talia: Probably less about trees and more about, like, flowers.
Oliver: I won't even make you roll for that since Zan canonically works in a flower shop. They look like, um, like the leaves you would see on, like, a rose bush. But they're not quite the right color. They’re kind of like a grayish green, maybe like a couple of them are a little bit tinged purple. But yeah, there's a there’s a big root down there.
ZAN: Hey, does anybody's magic spell things have anything about plants?
JASMIN: Uh, I have a shape water and goost, and…
ZAN: You have goose?
MAX: You can make a goose?
JASMIN: No. no, goost! Look, G-U-S-T.
ZAN: Oooh. Okay.
JASMIN: Um, stuff about magic... and lightning. Uh..
CODY: Whoa. Lightning?
JASMIN: Yeah, I think so.
CODY: Like pikachu?
JASMIN: Yes. Like pikachu. Actually, I think pikachu has this skill.
CODY: You have a pikachu on your wrist.
JASMIN: Um, but no, nothing with plants. I mean, my field, this kind of planty... But if you found a plant, I'd like to see it. I like plants.
ZAN: Yeah. Do you want to see this plant? It’s a good one.
JASMIN: Yeah!
Alice: Um, Jasmin is gonna go look at the plant also.
Oliver: Yeah, you get you both get down there on the floor, stick your eye to the little crack made,  and damn, there’s a plant there. Wow.
Talia: Can I summon my short sword?
Oliver: Yes! So, Zan dings her wristbands together, presses summon short sword, and in your right hand appears-- made of the same kind of transparent material as the shield Jasmin summoned earlier-- which, remember, Jasmin still just has an arm kind of flopping around, you get a-- a short sword appears in your right hand.
Talia: I am gonna try to pry up the tile with it.
Oliver: Great. Um, make a strength check.
Alice: Can I help her do this?
Oliver: Yeah, okay, let's say that, um, Jasmin is helping by... I guess just using her…
Alice: One hand?
Oliver: With your one good hand, kind of pulling it up?
Alice: Yes.
Oliver: That does nothing. So whatever Zan rolled is it.
Talia: Well, I rolled a six, so…
Oliver: All right. Yeah, it doesn't move.
ZAN: Well, I guess that's enough of that.
Oliver: I guess we're done there.
ZAN: Guess we’re stuck.
Robot: Max looks over and sees this, sees them struggling. And in my head, Max and Cody have just been fucking chillin. Like Cody's still chillin in Max's lap on the other side.
Oliver: They're both just kind of reckoning with this?
Robot: And I’ll be like,
MAX: Oh, let me help you with that!
Robot: And I'll just kind of like, unceremoniously stand up and dump Cody, out of my lap. And go over to try to pry the thing open.
Oliver: All right, you’re just gonna use your hands?
Robot: Uh, is the sword still in there?
Oliver: Oh, yeah. I think Zan’s just got the sword jammed in there. Not very far. She didn't do it very good.
Robot: I can try with the sword.
Oliver: Sure. Okay. Make a strength check.
JASMIN: What if it breaks and the shards go flying and we all lose our eyes? It’s a bad idea.
ZAN: I have cure wounds.
Oliver: Just go for it, I guess.
Robot: Well, it's a five, but I have a plus 2. So..
Talia: So it's slightly better than just--
Oliver: That’s nothing…
Robot: Uh huh.
Oliver: You get this sword, maybe, like a 1/2 an inch further and you push on it and it pops right back out.
ZAN: Wow, Max. I'm so happy you were here to help.
MAX: Uh, well, it's because of my hands aren’t chalked. Does anybody have any chalk?
ZAN: Oh, let me check. Uh, Nope. Just overalls and sneakers. Weird bracelets.
Oliver: Hey, they’re coveralls. They have sleeves.
JASMIN: Do you want to have two swords? I can have a sword I think.
ZAN: I don't think this is going anywhere. Can we check out the other loose tile?
Oliver: Um, yeah. So there there's another loose tile on.. this one's up, like on the wall, like on the barrier. It's not very high. It's like probably like, Zan’s head height. Again, I’ll keep your Nat 20. You can see that this tile is like bent a little bit. And it has been pulled out and then pushed back into place.
ZAN: Anybody else want to try pulling a tile out of a thing? Cause I have proved not very good at that.
JASMIN: I mean, it's just us here, and Cody.
ZAN: [Sighs]. Hey Cody, wanna try pulling a tile out of a wall?
CODY: Sure!
Alan: And so he's gonna press the button on his thing to call it out his quarter staff to give him a little bit more leverage.
Oliver: All right, great. A long staff appears in Cody's hands. How tall is Cody? Like Five feet?
Alan: Yeah about five feet.
Oliver: It's just under five feet, and it's about two inches in diameter, and it's again-- It's just like... when you hold it in your hands it has weight, but when you look at it, it's made of like translucent, clear material, and it's got kind of these, like shifting colors inside of it, kind of like pinks and yellows.
Alan: Cody is completely distracted by this thing, and he forgets what he was trying to do, and he's--
Oliver: That’s what I thought.
Alan: He’s looking through the staff at other people trying to, like, see if their faces get distorted and make them in you know, weird shapes--
Oliver: Yeah, they make weird shapes. Everyone's nose looks way too big for their face now.
Alan: He’s totally gonna do that. Someone's gonna have to remind him that he was supposed to do something. He's lost.
ZAN: Yeah. Max, do you want to just try hitting the thing with your wrench or something? Let him play with the stick.
CODY: Oh, I'll help. Sorry. It was pretty.
Talia: Yeah. No. Understood.
Robot: Can I hit it with a wrench, though?
Oliver: You're gonna just-- So there's a tile, that looks like it was once pulled out from the wall and put back-- I'm giving you a lot here-- and put back in that place. And you're asking me if you would like to take-- if you could take a wrench and hit it. You're just gonna hit. With the wrench? Go ahead, make a strength check for me.
Talia: Maybe at like a fun angle.
Oliver: No, he’s just hitting it!
Robot: Well.. this is the one time I'm hoping for a low roll. And of course, it's a 21.
Oliver: Okay. You see, Max, like “Oh, yeah, I'm gonna help so good now!” rears back with the wrench slams into the tile. And I’ll say that roll was so good that you slam it right into the dent where you see this tile has been bent. The corner just pops right up. So you now have a really good grip. You just pull it right off the wall.
Robot: I'm gonna look very triumphantly at the other three, and then try to rip it out.
Talia: Zan gives him a thumbs up.
Oliver: It’s been loosened.
Alice: Slow clap.
Talia: Two thumbs up. Good job.
[Slow clapping.]
Alan: Cody's back looking at his staff. He missed it.
{27:15}
Oliver: Yeah. All right. Sounds great. You missed it. Um, so you pull this tile off, it goes clattering to the floor. Behind it, you see this complicated array of blinking lights and a couple wires sticking out. Accessible to you are red wire, a blue wire, and a gray wire. And just at face value, it looks like a weird electrical thing. Unless one of you is going to tell me that your backstory’s an electrician's, that's all you get.
Alan: Well, Cody… [Laughter] I’m just kidding.
Alice: Cody goes to MIT.
Alan: He once saw a battery. Um.
[Laughter.]
Talia: What colors were they again?
Oliver: A red one, a blue one, and a grey one.
Alan: Uh, Cody having finally gotten done looking at the ethereal quarter staff, he's going to kind of get in close because he wants to see what the new thing is in the room. It's colorful. He wants to see it. Check it out and see if he can notice anything special about it.
Oliver: Yes, there's some blinking lights in there. Okay. You're want to roll an investigation check?
Alan: I absolutely want to do that. Whooops. Well, that's… that’s a six?
Oliver: You think the lights are really pretty. And then when you hold the quarter staff up to your eye again, they look so cool coming through the staff. Like it's just like big tendrils of pink are lighting up inside the staff and then, like, you can see the yellow and looks so cool.
CODY: [Giggles.] Whoa, That's awesome.
Alice: Oliver. Can I cast detect magic?
Oliver: Yes. Yes, you can. I forgot I gave you that. So let's do that now.
Alice: You did.
Oliver: I did. I totally did. So Jasmin touches her two wristbands together and presses the button that says detect magic. And so this is going to be stuff that only Jasmin can see. You all watch as this, like, blanket of that same like energy, flickers of pink and yellow, kind of like crawl over her skin and they get sucked into her eyes and her eyes are now glowing and swirling. Jasmin as you look around the room, you see that the tile with the plant in it, um, has kind of like a pinkish yellow glow coming from inside of it. But the rest of the room is not magical. Or is not lit up, anyway.
Alice: Um, so, Jasmin just does that and then kind of, like, sucks in some air before she does it, as if anticipating something, and when all she sees is that one tile she seems to relax and turns back to the plant tile and bends down and starts trying to wrench it up again.
Oliver: Okay, um, I'm going to say that since Jasmin still only has one hand, you just... you can't. You can't do it. It would be like trying to rip up your linoleum with just your hand.
Alice: And she also still has a dart in her in her shoulder, so...
Oliver: Ahe didn't take it out?
Alice: No.
Oliver: Oh, OKAY.
[Concerned laughter from rest of party.]
Oliver: Okay, I’m just gonna remember that.
JASMIN: I Can someone help me, please? I think this is important. It's glowing pink, which means-- I guess that means it's magical? Which is...
Talia: I'm pretty sure I can't try to do that again.
Robot: While while all of that was happening, huh, Max was like, my part's done. I did it. I'm good now and I just kind of wandered away.
Oliver: Okay??
Robot: Uh, I wandered over to like the middle of the wall area. And so... the middle of the wall is like, is it also solid? But it has--
Oliver: No, it's transparent.
Robot: It's, like, transparent and you can see, like electricity going through it.
Oliver: Right.
Robot: Uh, Max is going to go toe like the connection between the solid and transparent part…
Oliver: Uh huh.
Robot: And kind of like try to... surreptitiously, gingerly, poke the electrical part of the wall with one finger.
Oliver: [Concerned noises.] All right?? UHhh
Talia: Real quick. Is this like-- Is this like electricity encased in glass? Or is it like there's literally only electricity passing between these two parts?
Oliver: It’s like raw electricity. Actually, yeah. Alright, I’ll retcon, and say that with your again perfect perception check, you can see that the solid part of the wall is only about like, ah, six inches thick. And along that inner like-- where it turns from solid wall to electricity wall-- you can see these, like, nodes down that strip that are shooting out electrical beams that meet at the other at nodes on the other side.
Talia: I have an idea.
Oliver: Wait one sec
Robot: Look, I'm gonna poke it.
Talia: Oh, yeah. We need to have Max--
Oliver: Yes. So you watch Max yelp, jerk, backwards. Ah, and he takes only three points of electric damage. Yeah, Max, your finger hurts a lot.
Talia: Is that electric damage or is it lightning damage?
Oliver: Lightning damage. That's it. Thank you. Max is sileny through all of this.
Robot: Uh huh.
Oliver:  Your finger hurts.
Talia: Zan says,
ZAN: I really hope this goes better than the last time I said “Look it-- watch me!” um, so I'm not going to say, “watch me.”
Talia: But I am gonna walk through the electricity and, um, hope my absorb elements kicks in.
Oliver: [Pained] Oooh…
Talia: Because it should theoretically. But also I don't know that it will.
Oliver: All right. Um, well, let's see if it does.
Talia: I’m just gonna like, real fast, just try to, like, jump through it.
Oliver: You're just going to try to jump jump through it. All right, Let's see… [Pained] UM. SO.
[Laughter]
Oliver: [Pained] Ah, uh, fuck me.
[Laughter]
Talia: New character!
Oliver: All right, So you you all watch... I think the zap is loud enough that when Max touches the wall, you all kind of look over and see him pulling him back and be like, “Yikes, that hurt.” Um, even if he doesn't say anything and acts all cool and tough. And then you see Zan just run at the wall.
[Laughter]
Oliver: Oh, God. All right, you... you make it through and you're gonna take, uh… how many hit points do you have?
Talia: 11.
Oliver: Well, 11.
Robot: That's never a good question.
Alice: No, it isn't.
Oliver: You take 12 points of lightning damage.
{34:49}
Talia: Why? Why doesn't my spell work?
Oliver: ‘Cause you didn’t push the button?
Talia: I knew that that was the plan, and it's a reaction!
Oliver: All right. I want to say, if you just ran up to it and pressed absorb elements as you jumped through. Ah. Then you can cast it.
Talia: Okay.
Oliver: Okay. Um, you take-- great. Okay. So you only take six points of electric damage.
Talia: Great.
Alice: That’s significantly better!
Oliver: So you see Zan, just leap through this crackling blue electric wall, um, and then skid to a halt on the other side. I'm gonna say she falls over, because that fucking hurt.
ZAN: OW!
Oliver: Your whole body feels like it's on fire.
ZAN: OWWW!!
Oliver: Um, you got a--
ZAN: OH FUCK, NO!
Oliver: Your whole jumpsuit is singed.
ZAN: OH DON’T DO THAT!
Oliver: You do see, though, that she bursts for a second with this pink ligh, that kind of like, sucks some of the electricity back into her, and her hands are crackling with blue electric light.
ZAN: Fuck yes. Don't curse, Cody.
Alan: Cody looks back and forth between Max and Zan, and immediately forgives himself for not making his jump. Earlier. [Laughter.] He was feeling embarrassed, and he's feeling a little bit better.
ZAN: Don't do that. Don't follow me.
Alice: Jasmin just has her hands in her hair and looks absolutlely panicked.
Oliver: All right. Great.
ZAN: I'm just gonna lie here for a little bit, and, uh, in a couple minutes, maybe check to see if there's anything cool on this side of the wall.
JASMIN: Why did you do that?
Oliver: She's smoking. Not a cigarette. Her body is just smoking a little bit.
JASMIN: Maybe there's like a button to turn it off on that side?
ZAN: Yeah, just give me a minute.
Alan: Cody's gonna shoot a ray of frost at one of the nodes shooting electricity.
Oliver: Ooo, okay.
Alan: Well, that's a nine in total.
Alice: I mean, it's a static object.
Oliver: Yeah, I would say that hits.
Alan: Seven. (Damage.)
Oliver: Which one did you aim for? Let's say there's, like, four on both sides evenly.
Alan: I would say, uh, he's gonna aim for the bottom one on the one closest to him. On the side closest to him.
Oliver: Okay. Um, yeah. You hit it. A beam of, I guess just frosty air, shoots out of his hand and slams into this node, and it solidifies in like, an icy crust. Um, and let's see... the wall... Let me do some math.
Alan: Cody immediately looks at the Jasmin, eyes, just really big, Like--
CODY: Did you see that? What??
JASMIN: That was really cool! And very useful.
Oliver: Yeah, I’ll sat that that bottom note is disabled now. So that bottom noticed disabled. And you have about 2 or 2.5 feet, um, of space, between the floor and where the electricity starts.
JASMIN: Good job, Cody.
Alan: I think I'm gonna try to just get on my stomach. And just like like, not even army crawl, like even even like slower and more...
Oliver: Not army crawl. Just like a worm?
Alan: Yeah just kind of shuffle back and forth-- like it is not quick. It is not cool looking, but it's what Cody is going to do.
Oliver: All right, Cody, yeah. You make it under the wall. You’re just fine.
JASMIN: I really think that this tile is important, though. I.. I just... I don't have the strength to pull it up.
Robot: Max is gonna like shake out his is still hurting finger. And try to go over and pull this tile up again.
Oliver: Pull the tile up again? Here. Let's see…
Robot: Can I use the wrench?
Oliver: Yes. You can definitely use the wrench. And the wrencg fits into that gap a lot easier than the short sword did. So I’ll say you get it in there and then make an athletics check? Strength Check? Strength check.
Robot: Oh, boy. That's in Nat one.
[Laughter.]
Talia: Oh no, the wrench--
Robot: No...
Oliver: Max, I'm so sorry.
Alice: I wish I could do anything to help.
Talia: The wrench is the only thing we have!
Oliver: As you try to pry this tile up off the floor... That wrench-- you got it in there real good. And your hands still fucking hurts. And the the wrench digs right into the place on your finger where you got burned... and you let go. And that wrench goes, CLUNK. Clunk, clink, clank, [softer], clink, clunk, [even softer], clunk, clink. And it's in the hole.
Talia: Man, I have to rethink this whole can. I clearly did not listen well enough and did not realize that this was like, a DEEP hole.
Robot: Max just falls to his knees, and stares at his hands, and sheds a single manly tear for his wrench.
{40:14}
Alan: You just hear Cody from a distance--
CODY: Hey, did it all work? Did you get it?
JASMIN: Oh, I’m so sorry.
Oliver: And then you hear that chime again.
INTERCOM: DING DING. Calibration is 75% complete. Please proceed to testing chambers C for continued calibration. Please complete the testing calibration rooms in an adequate amount of time.
ZAN: Shut UP! UGH.
Robot: Still somber, Max is going to go over and bear crawl under the electricity, over to the other side.
Robot: So we got a very slow wiggle from Cody, and we're getting a somber bear crawl. You make it across.
Alice: Jasmin looks at the plant sadly, with her still glowing eyes, and then crawls-- walks over to the side, and also attempts to drag herself forward, but has one limp arm, so it probably looks rather pathetic.
Oliver: And then we get one pathetic slither from Jasmin, and with that, you’ve all solved my wall puzzle. And by that I mean you did not in any way. Except Cody. Dear God. You're on the other side. With the other door.
Talia: Still on the floor, Zan’s gonna touch her bracelets together and press the cure wounds button.
Oliver: Okay, great. Your second level one slot goes beep, and it's filled up. And yeah, so you can roll a D8 and then add your modifier, which is plus two and heal that many hit points.
Talia: Okay, let me find a D8. Uh, that's five, plus two did you say?
Oliver: Yes.
Talia: Oh, Okay, so that's-- I'm back up to full now.
Oliver: So Zan presses this button, lays a hand across her own chest, and just gives a short little gasp as pink and yellow energy flows out of her hand for a second, and then gets sucked into her body and all of her burns and wounds heal up. She looks right as rain.
ZAN: Well, let's go! Let's pretend nothing in this room happened. We will never speak of any of it ever again.
Alan: As everyone's getting up and getting to go uh, Cody will kind of get over near Max and just kind of embarrassed, kind of look up and just be like,
CODY: Hey, uh, you threw me real good. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't do it right. And then he just immediately, before Max can respond, runs to, like, join Jasmin, and make sure Jasmin's good.
Talia: Zan's at the door. I'm waiting. I want to get out of this stupid room as fast as possible and forget it forever.
Oliver: Yeah. The airlock slides open, and you can all leave this room.
=== START MIDROLL ===
{43:44}
Alan: Well, hello. Thanks for listening to our podcast Dice Disasters. We hope you’re enjoying the second episode we've posted for you. Joining me today. I have Talia.
Talia: Hey!
Alan: Yeah, Guess what, Talia?
Talia: What?
Alan: Oliver’s not here! They don't have control over this part of the podcast.
Talia: [Gasps.] So we could talk about all this stuff that we're not supposed to say on the podcast. Like teeth.
Alan: Like teeth. Yes, exactly. This is now Teeth Cast.
Talia: Teeth Cast! I'm just going to talk about cursed images that I found online. Saw one, it's just a bunch of wiggly hands.
Alan: Oh, gross. Okay, well, the internet is full of terrifying things, but you know what also is on the Internet?
Talia: What?
Alan: Our website.
Tala: [Gasps.]
Alan: How’d you like that segue?
Talia: We have a website?
Alan: We do. It's dicedisasters.com.
Talia: And what could I find if went to dicedisasters.com?
Alan: You know, first off, it's a wonderful website designed by our good friend Allison Otting, who, Spoiler alert, might be joining the podcast soon.
Talia: [Gasps.] No!
Alan: But there's cast bios, and character bios. We're also putting up our character sheets so that people who really want to know those numbers can dig in and see all our stats
Talia: All those nerds.
Alan: Ah, I love being a nerd. It's so fun.
Talia: Oh are you a nerd?
Alan: Oh, totally. 100%.
Talia: Good. Live your truth.
Alan: Yes, exactly, but yeah, if you want to tweet at us were @dicedisasters on Twitter. And you can also follow us on instagram dice.disasters. Where you know, here's the thing. I'm not good at instagram, so I don't know what images you post for a podcast, but--
Talia: It’s mostly teeth.
Alan: It’s mostly-- great. We do have one follow already. I saw. It’s an orthodontist which is, like, on brand.
Talia: They found this cause of all the teeth pictures. I snuck in there.
Alan: Apparently! I guess. But there are no… I mean, there aren't any teeth pictures. You know that, right Talia?You haven't done that yet.
Talia: That you can see.
Alan: Ohhhh, invisible Instagram pictures. Magic.
Talia: Emperor's new teeth.
Alan: But Talia.
Talia: Yes, Alan?
Alan: When it gets so structured, it sounds terrible. Um… But I love it so much, it makes me giggle. So Talia, let's say someone's out there listening wants to, you know, get involved with a podcast, maybe get their name put into the story or an item idea they have. How could someone do that?
Talia: Well, if they leave a review where they found the podcast or if they shared the show with the hashtag #dicedisasters, we might name an NPC after you!
Alan: [Gasps.] That’d be amazing.
Talia: And if they wanted to submit item idea, they could do that on our website, dicedisasters.com, and click the items submission page.
Alan: I really cannot wait. I don't know how Oliver is planning to give us items, seeing as we're trapped in a very bland, white room, but like, whenever we get items, I'm looking forward to like having some fun.
Talia: Just gonna drop from the ceiling.
Alan: Yeah, just random items start raining from the ceiling.
Talia: “Oh no!”
Alan: Just a random, like Pachinko room.
Talia: “Oh no! It just one-hit KO’d Cody!”
Alan: Yep. Spoiler alert, Cody only makes it through two episodes.
Talia: It was nice having you on the show, Alan.
Alan: Death by Pachinko. Thanks for listening! Hope you're enjoying the second episode. Stick around for the rest of it. And we have three more episodes posted on our feed already, that you can kind of deep dive into the story.
Talia: Very exciting.
Alan: Woohoo! Okay, bye!
Talia: Bye!
=== END MIDROLL ==
{47:32}
Alice: Jasmin offers her one functional hand to Cody.
Alan: And Cody helps Jasmin, I'm guessing off the ground, still, from the slithers, and walks with Jasmin out of the room.
Oliver: It takes Jasmin of minute to get up, even with help. She only got one arm, and the other one is now holding Cody's hand, so she’s just kind of splayed there. All right, uh, you go into that little air lock, the doors close, and then open. And so when the airlock doors slide open, you are in the middle of a long hallway. If you look out the airlock door in either direction, you see about 40 feet of hallway and a airlock door on either end.
Alice: Do I see any magic?
Oliver: No. You don't see any magic. At this point, it's probably been about 10 minutes, and so your, um, magic eyesight is going to fade now, I think.
Alice: Okay.
Oliver: You might not be able to tell the difference, though.
JASMIN: I I don't think there's any magic here, but I mean, the the thing just now was electricity, so that's probably not magic. And, like the dart probably wasn’t magic so--
INTERCOM: BING BONG. Unruly subjects perform well when exposed to choices. Please choose your next testing chamber.
Oliver: And with that, you see a glowing blue symbol appear above each door. The door to the far left has a small sword above it, and the door down the hall to the right has a shield. What do you do?
JASMIN: Shields don’t hurt, right? I mean, I have a shield. It doesn't like... you don't get stabbed by shields. I vote shield.
Talia: I don't really have a argument against that. So I'm fine with that, I guess. I don't know. I don't know. Apparently I'm not very good at decision making. So.
Oliver: I’d say none of you are.
Talia: Oh, before we do anything, I'm gonna position myself strategically next to Jasmin and then point in a random direction and say--
ZAN: Look something dangerous!
Talia: And then yank the dart out of her arm real quick.
[Laughter.]
Oliver: Okay, make a sleight of hand check, and Alice, make a perception check.
Alice: All right.
Talia: Sleight of hand. Okay. I rolled the 13.
Alice: I rolled in 19.
Talia: Aw, man.
Oliver: Okay. Jasmin, you watch as Zan reaches up and pulls the dart out of your arm. She’s just standing there holding it.
Talia: Of all the times for you to roll good.
JASMIN: Oh, uh…
ZAN: Sorry I was trying to distract you. So that it didn't hurt.
JASMIN: I mean…
Alice: She looks as if she was really scared and had expected something to happen. But then when nothing really happened after the dart emerged, she looks sheepish,
JASMIN: Oh, I-- I thought it was going to, like, spurt blood, like in films. Um, you know, I heard that if you get hit, you shouldn't take the thing out, so… I...
ZAN: Yeah but this was like, real small. Hey, Max. Want a dart?
MAX: Well, it’s no wrench, but... yes.
Talia: I hand Max the dark.
Oliver: All right, Max. You now have a small dart.
Alice: That has my blood on it?? Okay??
Robot: I’ll like, wipe it off from my jumpsuit pants.
Oliver: Great.
Talia: Don't poke yourself with that.
Alan: Cody has been standing looking at the two doors, back and forth, between the sword and the shield, trying to figure out how this has anything to do with Pokemon. Um, and also kind of frustrated because he doesn’t have a switch, so he doesn't know which one's better. He wants a Switch real bad. Um, and but he knows that if he was gonna have to pick one, he'd probably pick sword. And so he's leaning towards sword.
Oliver: Does he communicate any of this?
Alan: Well, he's just sitting there looking back and forth, trying to figure out.. Waiting for everyone else, like, to join him and figure this out.
Talia: Well, conveniently, while Zan didn't distract Jasmin from pulling the dart out of her completely numb arm, so that it didn't hurt, but it didn't hurt. On the plus side. She didn’t feel anything out of that arm. That is numb.
Alice: Yes.
JASMIN: Uh, wait. Um, are you OK? You were, like, really hurt earlier, Zan.
ZAN: Oh, yeah. Uh, no, I'm good.
JASMIN: Maybe we should, like, bandage you? I can probably tear some strips off this jumpsuit.
ZAN: No-- That's fine. That's, uh, I'm all healed up. No Band-AIDS required. I don’t really have anything funny to say about it cause I'm tired, and I just got shocked with a lot of electricity, but I'm not damaged, so let's go to a room.
Alan: Cody’s already standing by the sword door.
[Laughter.]
Oliver: You look away. You look back. Cody's 40 feet away, at the sword door.
[Laughter.]
ZAN: Where's the kid? Oh, oh shit--
Oliver: Yeah, it opens. It's one of those airlocks again, though.
Robot: Max is going over.
Alice: I will run after Cody.
Zan: I guess we all sprint down the hallway after Cody.
Oliver: All right, You run down the hallway. Surprising everyone, I assume, it's uneventful. Uh, you make it to the other end. You gonna get in that airlock?
Alan: Yeah, I guess so.
CODY: I like swords.
Oliver: All right. Great.
CODY: I onlt have a staff, though.
ZAN: Well, I got a sword, and I don't have-- I don't have a shield. So.. maybe that's a good sign.
Oliver: Um, Zan, have you been carrying your sword with you?
Talia: Yeah.
Oliver: Yeah. Okay. That's what I thought.
Talia: I'm not gonna leave it there.
{53:46}
Oliver: As the airlock doors slide open. You see the next chamber. This room is the largest you've been in so far. Just like the last rooms, there's an airlock on the opposite wall, and it's made of those same smooth white tiles. This room doesn't have any pits or traps. Instead, there's a tall, slender, automaton standing in the center. It is adorned with a few stark white plates connected with exposed metal joints. Its face is a smooth, featureless oval. In one hand... Well, it's not really a hand. It bears a long, sword-like arm on the other, a shorter one. Kind of like a big crab.
[Laughter.]
Oliver: Not now. I didn’t write that.
[Laughter.]
Oliver: I just thought of that right now.
Alice: Really? I was so sure you had written that down.
Talia: It was beautiful.
{54:36}
Oliver: God dammit. I shouldn't ad lib things.
Talia: [Almost crying.] It’s so beautiful.
Oliver: It is motionless. It is standing at attention. and facing towards you.
Robot: And in the background, it is playing the crab rave.
Oliver: No! It's not. It's quiet. It's kind of chilly. That chime sounds again, though.
INTERCOM: Ding dong. To proceed to the next chamber, defeat the automaton.
Oliver: And with that, a red symbol line lights up on the atomaton’s faceplate, and it begins to walk towards you.
ZAN: Uh, nope! Nope!
Oliver: Roll initiative!
Talia: Alright. Don't fail me now.
Alice: Is the door closed behind us?
Oliver: Uh huh.
Alice: Oh, fuck.
Alan: Seven for Cody.
Robot: 17.
Talia: 6.
Alice: 3.
Oliver: Max, you are up first.
Robot: We're all kind of just, like, piled by the door, right? And this thing's... how far from us?
Oliver: Um, I would say about 20 feet from you. Ah, yeah. I'm going to say the room is, like, 40 feet by 40 feet, and this thing's in the center.
Robot: Okay. Uh, I'm gonna... I've got nothing but a dart, so.
Oliver: Yeah, poor Max doesn't have any powers.
Talia: Oh shit, I forgot.
Robot: Let's do this. I'm going to go... I'm gonna go punch it.
Talia: Oh no. Oh no!
Alice: Oh no...
Oliver: All right. Um, yeah. OK, so you move up to it, go ahead. Make an attack roll.
Robot: It's a 9 + 4 = 13.
Oliver: You bring your fist back and slam it right into one of those metal plates, and it just bounces off to the side.
ZAN: Max what was that?
Oliver: You said 13. Right?
Robot: Yeah, 9 + 4.
Oliver: Yeah. Yep. You bounces off a metal plate, your fist, that you have.
CODY: That almost worked. But it didn't.
Robot: Yep. And I'm just gonna stand in there and…
Oliver: Look at it.
Robot: Body block it from the rest.
Talia: That's-- oh god.
Oliver: Next up is the automaton. Uh, it's going to take one of those big sword arms and attack you, and it gets a 13 to hit.
Robot: Yep, my AC’s 11.
Oliver: Yep, I believe all your AC is 11 because you're wearing jumpsuits. So…
Alice: Mine is 14.
Robot: Yeah. Unless your dexterity is really good.
Oliver: Oh, yeah. Jasmin is willowy like the water. She will slip out of your grasp. And you are going to take…
Talia: Mine’s 12.
Oliver: It brings down that sword and just kind of slashes you across the arm. And you take four points of slashing damage. Y'all see Max’s blood go flying. It’s gross.
CODY: UMM. UH OH?
ZAN: Max?
Alice: Scream.
ZAN: Don’t--
Oliver: and for its second attack--
ZAN: NOPE--
Oliver: It’s going to take that shorter sword arm and bring it across in the other direction. Woo. But it only gets a nine.
Robot: Okay.
Talia: [Sigh of relief.]
Oliver: So after you get hit once, you kind of suck backwards a little bit and it slides past you. Uh, ripping a tear across the center of your jumpsuit.
Alice: Making a boob window.
Oliver: Yep. Making a boob window.
[Laughter.]
Robot: Hell, yeah.
Oliver: Next up is Cody.
Alan: Um, Cody, kind of like takes... not like a lot of steps forward, but enough because he's worried and scared for Max and he goes,
CODY: Hey! Bulling isn't nice!
Alan: And he shoot ray of frost.
[Laughter.]
Oliver: All right, make a ranged attack roll.
Alan: Uh, 17.
Oliver: Yeah. Yeah, that hits. Uhm you shoot out array of frost and it blasts this automaton right across the neck.
Alan: Eight points of cold damage.
Oliver: Holy shit. All right. Okay. All righty then.,
Alice: Did you just roll maximum damage?
Alan: I did.
Talia: Oh, hell, yeah. Welcome back to three idiots saved by small child.
Oliver: And you said you moved a little closer to them. Are you going to move away?
Alan: Just a couple steps.
Oliver: Up next is Zan’s turn.
Talia: Could I summon… Can I like, de-summon my short sword and summon my longbow? Don't know how that works.
Oliver: You don't you don't have a button for that. You could put it down, and then just summon your longbow.
Talia: Sure.
Oliver: All right. Zan puts the sword down, and then she presses summon longbow. And in her left hand, emerging in both directions, shoots out this beautiful bow. It is again, the same transparent kind of yellowish, pinkish, swirly thing. And she's holding in her left hand and the string is just standing there taught. What do you do?
Talia: I would like to fire it at the automaton. Just-- just the whole thing.
Oliver: Just the whole thing, great.
Talia: I don't know if I could aim. So we're just gonna... I think I'm gonna aim for, like, the middle of it, just to sort of see what happens.
Oliver: Good call. I assume both you and Cody kind of like moved a little over to the side so you can see the automaton past Max. Um, I won't make you do too much placement things, but you're not gonna try to shoot it through Max into the automaton.
Talia: Nope!
Oliver: Yeah. OK, so you both moved over a little bit. So you brace the handle of the bow in your left hand.
Talia: I don't know how this works.
Oliver: Just grab the string and pull back. And as she pulls back, out of that same material, a shimmering arrow, nocked, loaded, ready to go. So why don't you roll a D20, a ranged attack roll.
Talia: That's a 10. Do I add anything to it?
Oliver: Yes, you should have..
Talia: Is it hit?
Oliver: Yeah, it's “to hit.”
Talia: OK, so that's 14.
Oliver: Um, just doesn't make it.
Talia: Damn it.
Oliver: You shoot this arrow, and it almost is gonna hit it in the middle, and then because it’s an automaton, it's got metal joints, and it just kind of whizzes through one of the holes and goes and clatters off across the room, the other end of the room. So next up is… do you move anywhere?
Talia: Uh, I'm gonna like… Yeah, I'm just gonna, like, sort of scoot back a little bit more, maybe try to like, start moving te like the right of it. This is in the center of the room?
Oliver: Okay. So, like, kind of flanking?
Talia: Yeah. Yeah, but like keeping towards the edge of the wall.
Oliver: Great. Well, so you're, like, 25 feet or so away from it. Um, cool. All right. Next up is Jasmin.
Alice: I have a very important question for you, Oliver. Yes, which is in the menu... do I just see the spell name or also what it does?
Oliver: You do see a short description of what it does. You can also see whether, like the range of it, um, the area, the duration, and that stuff.
Alice: Okay.
Oliver: Just say it’s what I have written there. But like without the number of dice.
Alice: That makes sense.
Oliver: Actually. You know what? Sure. It does say the number of dice there. I’m making a decision. It just says what’s there.
Alice: Um, Jasmin is going to sort of look between Cody and Zan, and look between Cody and Zan, and look between-- and eventually run over to Cody and just try and stand in between Cody and the automaton with the shield up.
Talia: Aww.
Alice: Um and she opens the menu, which is very difficult because they her left arm won’t move. So she's like trying to touch the right arm to the left arm and then, uh, presses goost, and holds up her one working arm to try and push the automaton away from them.
Oliver: Okay.
Alice: She yells out,
JASMIN: Goost!
[Laughter.]
Oliver: So I think they're going to make a strength saving throw. So actually, Max, you'll also have to make one. The automaton got a 10, which I assume fails.
Alice: I think it does. Yes. I'm trying to figure out what my spell save DC is.
Oliver: It's above your strength and dexterity.
Alice: 13.
Oliver: All right. So automaton gets pushed five feet backwards.
Robot: Yes, that sounds about right for gust.
Alice: Pretty sure it's goost.
Robot: I got 12 + 2 = 14.
Oliver: So you save, so you don't get pushed. So the automaton gets-- just this burst of air pulses out of Jasmin's outstretched hand, and the automaton kind of braces and slides backwards five feet away from you. So you're now out of melee range of the automaton.
Robot: Do I get an attack of opportunity on it when it leaves range? I don't know if it counts when something else moves it out of range.
Oliver: I'm going to say no…
Robot: That's fine.
Oliver: Yeah, but it is your turn.
Robot: Ah, well.
Talia: You could like, run?
Oliver: Just Zan’s casual comment.
ZAN: Hey uhh, maybe like, go away from it?
Robot: I guess I'm just gonna move away from it?
Oliver: It's a good plan.
Robot: And I guess. Just stand there. Can't do anything.
Alan: Is there still a sword on the ground?
Robot: There is. There's a sword on the ground by the door.
Talia: Yeah I left my sword there.
Oliver: There is.
Robot: I'm going to go pick up that sword.
Oliver: Okay. Yeah, you go pick it up.
Robot: I'm going to go move between the automaton and Cody, and ready an attack if it comes this way.
Oliver: Great.
Alan: Do I have two people guarding me now?
Oliver: Yes. You’re two deep. So to ready an attack, I need you to tell me what the attack is, and what is the trigger for the attack.
Robot: Just a sword slash if the automaton starts coming this way.
Oliver: So if the automaton’s within range you're going to hit it with your sword. Perfect. All right, now it is the automaton’s turn.
Alice: The automaturn.
Oliver: The automaturn, doo doo do do do.
[Laughter.]
{1:06:19}
Oliver: And you hear that chime agaon.
INTERCOM: Bong bong. Proceeding to initiate calibration on uncalibrated subject.
Oliver: And the automaton stalks forward towards you, and it's gonna try to swipe at Max again. Oh, that's right. Max's action actually goes first. So, Max, you can roll your attack first.
Robot: I don't have a thing for the sword. So you have to tell me what my bonus is.
Oliver: I'll tell you. So you roll it and then I’ll tell you.
Robot: It’s an eight.
Oliver: And it's gonna be plus zero.
Robot: So just eight.
Oliver: So you wiff. I'm guessing you have never held a sword in your life.
Robot: Nope.
Oliver: So you go to hit it on the big robot, and it kind of clanks and doesn't do anything.
Robot: I'm just distracted by my profusely breeding arm.
Oliver: Yes, all right. So that whiffs. Uh, conveniently, when it takes a strike at you, it gets an eight, also whiffs. Um, and for its second attack, it gets a 10. And it whiffs again. You guys are uhhh, going pretty lucky against the big scary robot.
Talia: I'm glad it’s such a bad robot.
Oliver: And it is Cody's turn.
{1:07:49}
Alan: So Cody's behind Jasmin still?
Oliver: It goes, in a line, automaton, Max, Jasmin, Cody. Zan’s kinda off to the side.
Talia: Doing her own thing.
Alan: Yes, Cody's gonna do his best, to like, roll to the side, but like, he's 12 and he thinks he looks really cool doing it, but like, it's not exactly the smoothest. It’s kinda more like a barrel roll, on its side, not the full, like somersault, off to the side. And he's gonna pull up his menu and press the only button he hasn't pressed yet. And he's very excited, because it has the word magic in it, and he's gonna cast magic missile.
Oliver: Oooh, nice. So these automatically hit, and you see three beams of energy just shoot out of Cody’s--
Alan: Can I say I’m aiming at his torso, but at the at the joint, where his arm with the big sword is?
Oliver: Yes. These three beams of energy shoot out of Cody's hand and slam one after the other into the automaton. You’re gonna, roll a D4 three times.
Alan: Three times. Okay, 3, 4, 3.
Oliver: Damn. You do 10 points of damage. And I'll say that the arm with the big sword is now just shooting out sparks, like at the joint. And the entire automaton is kind of like, jerking a little bit side to side. And it is Zan’s turn.
Talia: Um, I'm gonna I watch Cody zap that arm real good, and I'm gonna ready my longbow and also try to shooting an arrow at that same joint.
Oliver: Great. Okay, So make a ranged attack roll.
Talia: That’s a...15
Oliver: 15. Uh, yeah, that hits. Yes. Go ahead and roll damage.
Talia: That's a six.
Oliver: Jesus. All right. The automaton is not looking very good at all. It has got one... Ah, it's big sword arm is now hanging limp, just kind of dangling there. And it's not the first time you have seen an arm that doesn't work very good today.
[Laughter.]
Robot: We’ve got three of them in this room!
Talia: Yeah, it's a bad day for arms. Uh, it is Jasmin's turn.
Alice: Jasmin, um, would really like to help, but doesn't have a lot of options, so she's going to try and hit it with her shield.
Oliver: All right.
Talia: I’m picturing Jasmin just like running up and like, whacking it.
Oliver: Um okay. Make a melee attack.
Alice: Okay, I'm just going to roll it. You tell me.
Oliver:  Roll a D20.
Alice: That is a nine.
Oliver: Okay, question. Did you run up, like, right next to Max, or did you go, like, on the other side of the automaton?
Alice: I guess Jasmin thinks that Cody's well protected now and she's worried about Zan. So she's going to go to the other side just to be in between the automaton and Zan.
Oliver: All right, So I'll give you advantage since you're now flanking this giant automaton with Max.
Alice: Okay.
Oliver: And its staring down the barrel at Max, and you're kind of whacking your shield into its, butt, so go ahead and roll again.
Alice: Four.
Oliver: All right.
[Laughter.]
Oliver: Y’all watch as Jasmin runs over there, and I imagine she's running so her left arm is just kind of flopping wildly. She's got the shield on her right hand. She goes with her full body weight, clonks the automaton, right on its metal ass, and then staggers backward a few feet.
Alice: Yep.
Oliver: It didn't do anything. But she tried. She tried really hard. And she's now flanking this automaton. And it is Max’s turn.
Robot: Well, I'm just... Ah, just gonna swing again.
Oliver: Alright, roll a D20 plus zero.
Robot: Oh, thank God. 18.
Oliver: Oh, nice. All right, so you use your big football muscles and heft up this sword. Slam it down into-- Are you hitting it anywhere in particular?
Robot: No, I'm just hitting the shit out of it.
Robot: You hit it, on it. Great. Go ahead and roll one D6.
Robot: three.
Oliver: Okay, man, this automaton is looking very rough and as Max brings down the sword he manages to hit in that joint that all of you have been just destroying. And with this hit, the automaton’s big sword arm kind of just clanks down to the side. And it is, like, completely limp. Just dead weight. It's got with one little sword arm shooting sparks. It’s a sad automaton.
Alice: Hey, guys. It was a joint effort.
Talia: Heyyy.
Alan: Cody doesn't get it.
Alice: Jasmin doesn't even say that. It's just me, Alice, saying that.
[Laughter.]
Alan: Gotcha. Alan definitely does get it, and appreciates it.
Oliver: It is now the automaton’s turn, and you hear that chime again.
INTERCOM: PING PONG. Calibration subject 2411 has not yet manifested. Commencing additional calibration.
Oliver: And it is going to take its short little sword arm and swing it down on Max again.
Talia: Don't think this robot knows what calibration means.
Oliver: And it rolls a 23
Robot: Jesus.
Oliver: Uh, no, not a nat 20. A dirty 23. Let's see, where did I put…
Talia: That’s still many numbers.
Alice: Just a real filthy twenty three. A gross 23.
Robot: This robots gonna feel real guilty in a second, when I die.
Alice: Just a rancid 23.
Oliver: As it brings down this sword. Um, Max, what do you do? Do you close your eyes? You just kind of curl up in a ball? Do you just stare down this sword?
Robot: Ah, I'm gonna say I try and failed to block it with the other sword. And then just kind of in that millisecond just accept it and stare it as it comes down at me.
Oliver: All right. So you see, Max, bring up his own short sword-- well. Zants short sword.
Talia: Yeah.
Oliver: --and it just slides right off the edge of this blade. And this, automaton slams down its sharp arm right into Max's gut.
ZAN: UGH!
Oliver: And Max, you take six points of damage.
Alan: Cody screams in a way that you all haven't heard him, yet, because the severity of what's happening is dawning on him for really the first time. And he is... tears are starting to well up. And he is screaming for Max from where he is.
ZAN: Shit shit shit shit.
Oliver: Max goes down hard. Uh, the automaton, pulls its razor arm out of his gut, and it's nasty and gory and happening in real life. And Max staggers for a second before meatily just slamming into the floor.
ZAN: Shit!
Oliver: And the automaton, kind of leans forward, cocks its head and just watches. Um, and in that moment, you see an energy. It starts as a little flicker, right around Max's torso, and then a wave of it just bursts up and out of him and covers him in this shimmering pink and yellow light. Max, you gasp as your heart restarts as your whole body just shudders with the effect of this magic and you have been healed for four hit points. So you're back up to four. Um, and Max is breathing, I assume, heavily, on the ground. He still looks real bad, but he is definitely alive and awake. And that giant rip across his gut has sealed over. Um, and with that, the automaton, uh, that symbol on its face turns blue and it stands back upright. And you hear that chime.
INTERCOM: BING BONG. Congratulations. Your exposure to the sympathetic parallel energy has manifested into abilities congruent with the PALADIN designation. You may now access the main menu of your sympathetic parallel energy liaison. Touch your proprietary SPEL prototype response together to access the main menu. Calibration complete. Please proceed to testing chamber F.
Alan: Cody immediately runs to Max, screaming.
CODY: Max! Max!
Alan: And he comes over and he's just like sobbing.
CODY: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean-- It is my fault. I picked-- the room. I'm so-- please be okay! I'm so sorry!
Robot: Max is just kind of laying there on the ground, breathing heavily for a while.
Oliver: Yeah, pulling a Zan.
Talia: Yeah, that’s fair. Zan’s gonna look up at the ceiling. Where approximately the voice seems like it's coming from, and just start like yelling like--
ZAN: What the-- What are you doing? Why do you-- Why are you doing this to us? Why? What? What? What is going on?
Oliver: There's no answer.
Alice: Jasmin is just standing where she was standing, uh, frozen. And the only part of her body that isn't shaking is her limp arm.
Oliver: Um, actually, Jasmin as you're standing there. Um, your left arm starts to feel kind of tingly, and, uh, kind of like you slept on it funny, and it went numb. And now it's starting to regain some of the feeling in it. You can like, move your fingers a little bit.
Alice: Oh fun. So that's starts shaking too.
[Laughter.]
Talia: Zan goes over to where Max and Cody are and is like,
ZAN: I'm so sorry. I can't heal you because I healed myself when I did a dumb thing earlier. And you didn't do a dumb thing. And I shit..
Talia: Can we like, help-- Help him up?
Oliver: Yeah, you can help him up.
MAX: Uh, so that hurt... that.. Did I-- Am I dead?
ZAN: Uhh-- I don't know. You looked not.. super.. Breathy.. I guess.
CODY: Are you okay?
JASMIN: You look terrible.
MAX: Uh, you know, I kind of still feel like shit. Yeah.
ZAN: Yeah I’m gonna be honest, you don't look great.
MAX: But I'm not dead, so. Oh, wait. Does this mean I can do things now?
Robot: I'm gonna I'm gonna touch the things together.
Oliver: Yeah, you touch your wristbands together and a little menu appears above your left wrist, same as before. But this time you have options like summon long sword, summon shield, and then cast: shield of faith, cure wounds.
ZAN: Hey, that last one looks pretty good.
MAX: Oh, yeah, I have wounds.
[Laughter.]
Robot: I'm gonna touch cure wounds.
Oliver: All right. Great. Um, roll a D8.
Robot: Uh, which one is that? This one? Yeah. No, not this one. This one. That is eight. Sick.
Talia: Oh damn.
Talia: Okay, you put your own hand on your chest and give a big gasp, and you basically defibrillate yourself, with llight just pouring out and into you and you are healed back up to full. You feel great. You feel jazzed. You could run a marathon right now.
Robot: And I still have a boob window.
[Laughter.]
Alice: Yes you do.
Oliver: Yep, your jumpsuit was not healed.
Talia: Zan just sort of rubs her hands down her face, goes like--
ZAN: All right, nobody else can get hurt. Cause now we really don't have any more... healy whatsits.
JASMIN: We really should bandage that. It's just because just because it looks fine doesn't mean it is. Maybe you'll get, like, infected.
ZAN: You tell me where to put a Band Aid on there. [Quieter.] I don't have a Band Aid.
Oliver: Uh, yeah. Jasmin. Do you wanna roll a medicine check?
Alice: Um, I, sure, but I think that regardless of whatever the result is, Jasmin is going to try and tear bandages from her jumpsuit.
Oliver: Okay. Great. Roll a medicine check.
Talia: Where on the jumpsuit? Like the middle?
Oliver: Also a titty window.
[Laughter.]
Alice: So it's plus three. Uh, 7 + 3 = 10.
Oliver: 10. All right. Um, he looks okay. Yeah. You can't tell much beyond that.
Alice: I'm still going to try and rip some.
Oliver: Okay, you just gonna use your hand?
Alice: I summon my ethereal short sword.
Oliver: All right, so you're sitting there on the ground, and Jasmin just pulls out a sword. Uh, yeah. I think your left calf is kind of torn up from your shark bite before. But you just gonna go  sleeveless?
ZAN: So he doesn't have any injuries, so now you're gonna make some? What is this?
JASMIN: No, no, I'm going to-- look.
Alice: She very awkwardly holds the short sword, which is absolutely also shaking because you notice that her hand is still shaking. While holding the shaky short sword. She slowly moves it towards her own left left calf. To try to tear, strips of cloth from the jumpsuit.
ZAN: But like bandaging is for covering like a break in the skin. Or control bleeding. Or prevent infection. This is not... there's nothing. I don't think any of that's a problem here.
Oliver: Are you gonna stop her? Or is Jasmin gonna try to cut her own pants off?
Talia: I'm going to try to stop her from cutting her own pants off.
Oliver: All right. I’m gonna say that you easily overpower her because she is shaking and still one-armed.
Talia: I’m just gonna, like, slowly, sort of push the short sword down, and be like--
ZAN: [Softer voice.] Hey, uh, maybe don’t. Don’t.
Alan: Cody wipes his eyes in the way the only kids do where they just look like they’re pushing so hard in their eyes to make the tears stop that it can't be comfortable. He's looking down at Max's feet and can't make eye contact. He's just like--
CODY: I'm sorry.
Alan: And then he walks over to kind of either try to help Jasmin, or help... He's unsure what he's going to do. He's just not gonna be around Max right now.
Oliver: He just also puts his hand on the sword. Like, I guess we're all holding this now. And I'm a child.
INTERCOM: BING BONG. Please proceed to testing chamber F.
Alice: Do these do these swords have like, sheaths? Or?
Oliver: They don’t.
ZAN: Yeah, I don't think I don't carry both of these. Okay, I guess I'll keep carrying the bow and Max and keep carrying the sword for now.
JASMIN: Max do you want a second sword?
MAX: Um, you know, as cool as that would be, I think-- I think I have my own now?
JASMIN: Okay, um--
Alice: She looks at her hand.
JASMIN: I don't think I should have a sword. So I'm just going to leave this here.
Oliver: Alright, Jasmin puts the sword down.
JASMIN: I don't like this.
INTERCOM: BING BONG. If you do not proceed to the next testing chamber, you will be incentivized to do so.
ZAN: We should probably go to the next room.
Robot: Yeah, Max is gonna hop up and jump around a little bit test out his, uh, his current limberness, and then walk out.
Oliver: He feels great.
ZAN: All right. Um.
Alan: Cody's quieter than a 12 year old usually is. But as he slips out behind the whole group, he slowly picks up the sword and hides it behind his back as they go in the next room.
Oliver: Okay, um, Cody still have his quarter staff too?
Alan: Yeah.
Oliver: Yeah. Okay. Great.
Talia: Can we roll to see if we notice this child holding a sword?
Oliver: Yeah go ahead and make a sleight of hand check, Cody.
Alan: That would be a... 11.
Alice: I really want this to succeed.
Oliver: Yes. Okay. Actually, I think all of your passive perceptions are high enough that you're fine. You see, Cody, pick up the sword. He's clanging. Clanging his way towards the airlock.
Talia: I’m gonna pretend that I didn't notice.
Oliver: Nice.
Robot: Max doesn't actually.
Alice: I know that my passive perception is good enough to notice by far. But I think that Jasmin is too distracted.
Robot: Yes, Max definitely still has his head buried in the menu.
Oliver: Just reading about all of it.
Talia: And Zan’s just like, “This is fine. Kids gotta have a sword sometime.”
Oliver: All right. Great. Um, so you all pile into that airlock? You going testing chamber F?
Talia: Yeah.
Oliver: All right. The door slides closed behind you. Um, and this time, the door in front of you doesn't open. Stays ringed in red.
ZAN: Aw, tits.
Oliver: You stand there for a minute. Kind of like when you're waiting for an elevator door, and it just doesn't go. And, you’re all feeling pretty tired and beat up.
Talia: Nooo.
Oliver: Even Max. Even though you're feeling good, you're like, I just feel so good. I could take a good nap right now. And, uh, Jasmin again, you hear that same faint hissing noise.
Alice: Can I cast goost?
[Laughter.]
Oliver: Yeah! Go for it.
Alice: Um, I try to cast goost.
Oliver: All right, everyone make a strength saving throw.
Talia: That's a 15.
Alan: 13.
Oliver: Uh, Cody and Zan, you both brace yourselves and get kind of hit by this gust of wind. Um, does Max save?
Robot: I got 21.
[Laughter.]
Oliver: Yeah, Max didn't even notice. His hair ruffles a little in the wind.
Talia: I think it doesn’t even do that.
Oliver: He’s still looking at him menu-- [Laughs] Great, his hair doesn't ruffle. I’d say you buy yourself another minute or so. Do you do anything else? Do you guys care that Jasmin cast gust on you?
JASMIN: I think there's some sort of gas. Uh, maybe? It's probably up-- It's-- it's-- it's open the ceiling. Maybe you can destroy it before we faint again?
ZAN: Ah...
Oliver: I will give everyone one action if they want to take it.
Talia: I'm gonna fire an arrow at it because I have nothing else that I can think of to do. Can I ask Jasmin to point it out?
Alice: Yeah, she does with her one hand, which is where the air is coming from. So she shoots air exactly at the thing.
Oliver: She's still blowing air over, great. Actually, uh, why don't I have Jasmin roll a perception check.
Alice: All right. 14 +4 = 18.
Oliver: All right. So the airlocks are like, six foot by six foot squares, but they're about eight feet high. And as you look up, you see a little grate, uh, kind of like, built into the edges of one of the tiles, and the gas is definitely coming out of that. So, uh, Zan roll an attack role with advantage because you know exactly where you're aiming.
Talia: It is a grate, so I don't really know what this is going to do other than, like, dent it, but…
Alice: It's going to go great!
Talia: Well, that's great, 8 + 4.
Oliver: Did you do advantage?
Talia: No, I did not do advantage.
Oliver: Yeah. Do it with advance because, you know exactly where it is.
Talia: That is a 15 total.
Oliver: Alright. Yeah. You shoot one of your ethereal arrows right into that grate. It hits it. Um, and the grate pops off and clatters down to the floor and you see the output of a small tube up there.
Oliver: Max and Cody, you have an action if you want to take it.
Robot: Ah, I've got nothing. I'm just a dude with a sword.
Talia: Can you [Laughing] can you put the dart into the hole?
[Laughter]
Robot: How big is the dart? And how big is the tube?
Oliver: They would actually go great on that Reddit for things fitting perfectly into other things. They're like-- the tube opening and that dart are the exact same size.
Robot: Okay. Can I reach the ceiling?
Oliver: Can you reach up eight feet? What’re you like 6 feet tall?
Robot: I’m six foot two. So I think I could reach it.
Talia: Jesus, two very tall people and two very short people.
Robot: Yep!
Oliver: All right.
Robot: Yeah. I'm gonna try to shove the dart in it.
Talia: Okay. Um, do you stick it pointy end first?
Robot: Yeah, pointy end first.
Oliver: So you stick the dart right in there, um, and yeah, you can hold it in there. And the gasses stopped. I guess. Uh, and you heard the chime, that says--
[Laughter]
INTERCOM: BING BONG. Please do not tamper with facility infrastructure. You need to be reset for calibration.
ZAN: No!
JASMIN: Yeah. I really don't want to be reset.
Oliver: All right. Um, and then since this was where I was going, to end the episode…
[Laughter.]
Oliver: I’m going to say we'll end it here, with the four of you jammed into this little cube. Ah, with a dart in a hole, defiantly saying “no” to the voice that you still don't know where it's coming from. And that'll do it.
Alan: Can Cody take his action?
Oliver: Go for it.
Alan: Cody just leans up against the wall and sits down, and just says, to kind of to himself, But loud enough, that everyone can hear--
CODY: We tried... so hard.
Alan: And he kinda just sits there.
Tallia: Oh, no.
Oliver: And with that, we’ll leave our four wayward humans stuck in a closet until next time.
