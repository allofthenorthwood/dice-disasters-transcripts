you're sitting in a cozy living
room with a lumpy couch around a crackling fireplace. Erica is wrapped up in a big, fluffy bathrobe
given to her by Lili, the large, half goat woman who has been bustling around getting you settled into their little home in the woods. Max has hidden his first cup of tea and a plant and is now holding a second cup that he doesn't want to drink. ZANIS sitting uncomfortably on the couch, quietly petting hat. The rat Cody is curled up in an oversized armchair looking at the door. Nuwa, the quiet human with braids piled on their head, has just broken the news to Jasmin that turning into animals is not only dangerous but also greatly feared by most people. The four of you backs Erica, Cody and Zan are sitting in the living room in awkward silence. What do you do? Zan stands up, puts hat back on her shoulder on to sort of stand there for, like, an awkward second before just sort of say, uh, I, I'll be outside. And then she walks out of the door. Lili, who has regained some of her composure, looks down at Cody and smooths the front of her dress.
Well, that was very informative. Um, Cody, Sweetheart, would you like to help me do the washing?
Um, sure. Oh. Warn you, I'm not
good at folding. That's okay.
I don't I'm not allowed to fold at home.
That's okay. I'll do all of the folding. Lovely. Lovely. OK, OK, sure.
She gets up and she scoops two bowls of stew and hands them to you. She trots out of the room and comes back with a pile of clothes, including Erica's stained purple jumpsuit.
Um, Erica dear, Would would you get the
door for me? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. And, ah, Erica gets up very much trying to hold the robe together and and opens up the door.
Great. Um, actually, come on. Now, both
of you, Weaken. Go sit in the sun and get this all cleaned up. Um, and she bustles Erica and Cody out the door and into the sunlight. As he step outside, you get a glimpse of nuwa and Jasmin heading into that big glass dome in the center of the garden. You also see Zan on the far side of the clearing hands stuffed in her pockets. as she paces along the tree line
this way, this way,
Cody fall slightly behind. When he kind of looks over at Jasmin, just squint a little bit, tryingto make sure she's OK, but then realizes he's a little bit behind and runs to catch up. Come
on. Okay. Erica is also struggling to keep up with this robe trailing behind her.
Yeah, it's big and heavy.
Cody, upon catching up, sees this and tries to, like, pick up the back to kind of get some slack off the ground
and, like, try failed.
And I am startled and I scream because I'm thinking that someone is pulling the robe off of me. But then when I see that it's Cody family Oh, yeah, thank you very much. Just
try to help. Sorry. So sorry. Look it between the two of you. Yeah, You wrangle this
giant bathrobe and Lili leads you down to the stream that cuts through the clearing. And there's, like, a few wide, flat rocks. Um, over here on Lili dumps the dirty clothes on one of them and gestures the two of you to sit on the other rocks.
Eat, eat.
She points at the bulls Cody is carrying and she actually pulls two spoons out of her apron and hands them to you.
Um, so don't worry about Jasmin. Newly
will take very good care of her. Um, on. And
you all can. You can stay as long as you like. We never get
visitors out here other than Remmy, of course. And I'm so happy to host. Um, and she starts just like washing the clothes in the stream. And it's like, So, um, do you know any
songs? I learned to dance. Oh, you did? I love dance. Can I see it?
And Cody looks America like, Are you gonna join
me? I don't know if
I could manage the dance right now, but I can sing the song for you. Cody. Oh, please, Please. Oh, no. What is the words to spooky? Scary, scary. Um, I look at Cody and and ice ice shyly start seeing spooky scary skeletons and shivers down your spine. Shrieking skulls will shock your soul. Seal your doom tonight. I don't want to see what um, what Lili's reaction is to these very a creepy lyrics is she's
delighted. She is just like, lit up. Cody Can you roll a performance? Check it and see
already have. It's a 14. Oh, nice. Cody does it. Pretty good dance. He's a little more nervous than last time. Oh, that's a wonderful I love it. Great.
Well, how? I don't know, But I
have a feeling you don't have. Ah, washing machine.
So, um, how do we do this?
A machine? Oh, you you eat, I'll do the
first couple. And you see, she's like pulled some like a bar of bluish soap out of her pocket and is like scrubbing down some of the clothes and then rinsing them. And then she washes Erica's jumpsuit first. And like the purple goo comes right out as soon as she puts the soap on it.
Oh, thank goodness. Erica says
she rinses it and then pulls it out of the stream and just kind of flicks it like off, like, not on to either of you. And it's totally dry. And she, like, fold it up and puts it on the rock next to her and then grabs the next thing and keeps washing.
Uh, hey. Hey, Erica. Yeah. Um So, like, I haven't gotten to spend a whole
lot of time with you.
Um, cause you're you know, you kinda popped out of the tube a little bit after I met everybody else, but, uh, I'm I'm happy you're with us now.
Thanks, Cody. I am really happy that you guys found me before you found a way out of there because I don't know what it would have happened to me if you had left without letting me out of that too.
Oh, I didn't even think about that. Oh,
yeah, Pretty
scary. I'm I'm glad that I'm here and that we have found a friend and Erica smiles warmly at Lili.
Oh, stop off. Oh, I feel so. Oh, I feel so included. And
she's, like, continues washing and is like paying 1000% attention to both of you. She says she loves this interaction to Do you
know any more dances? I mean, not right
now. I see you said there the road, but like, yeah, are there more that we could maybe
try some time? Oh, yeah. Um, I usedto learn dances with
my cousin. Oh, up my cousin Paige.
Oh, How does page she is
actually 20 0 yeah. She's 20 years old that's
close to my sister's age.
Um, yet you were. We're a little bit weird to be learning these dances sold, but it's ah, we're about dancing. You're right. You're right. Thank you, Cody. He said Jessica's almost 20. Uh, yeah, she's She's seven years
older than me. So, uh, uh, doing 19. Yeah. I think she's 19. Her birthday. I don't know when her birthday is compared to now. It was coming up, but I don't know what day it is. So maybe she's 20 by now. I don't know.
Hopefully we can get back soon so that you can spend some time with her for a birthday. Yeah, I bet she'll be really excited to see you.
I'll be excited to see her.
Where does your sister
live? Oh, well, I mean, she She goes to college, I guess. I guess
she live at college.
I would think home is home where I am, but she spends most of her time over in Kentucky. You two people, I don't know where Kentucky is.
Mm. I don't I'm so
sorry. That's OK. It's It's a ways off. It takes a bit of time to get. They're So I don't know. I didn't I don't see her often. Um, but yeah. Where does where does page live? Erica?
Oh, Paige and I live in the same town. Um, in Monmouth. That's cool. But, uh, yeah, I miss her. Speaking of age, Lili, how if this isn't too rude? How old are you?
Oh, not not rude at all. I am 70
two. I turned 72 last winter.
You don't look a day over 30.
Oh, you're so sweet. Thank you. Um, I guess that
would be weird, though, if I was 30. Oh, my thirties were just Oh, I was a mess, but, um,
yeah, how well do you to? I
am 26. I'm
12. I'm I'm the youngest in our group.
So little love kids.
I'm almost not a kid anymore.
Just a little baby.
But I
so precious, What would you in my pocket? Cody smiles. Delightful. Lili, do you happen to have
any maps or anything laying around?
Oh, I'd love to kind
of learn more about the area.
We do we to
actually have a couple maps. Um, and she, like, looks over at the dome, and she's like
they're in the greenhouse and ah, week. Wanna we go in
there after, um, after after Jasmin and Mulan of Have had some time to talk to
have any other maps? Oh, yes. Actually, in my book,
um, there's a little map at the beginning. Uh, actually, Cody dear, um, could
you could you go grab the latest edition from the house? For me?
It's a big green and silver book, and it's on the shelf above the bed. You just go in and through the living room and down the hall, and then you turn the left and you go up a little staircase, and then the bedroom's right there, and it's above the bed.
Cody started running the moment she'd asked, and he missed the last half of what she
said. Okay, great. Thank you. So, dirt. So good luck. Following directions. Okay. Roll of
perception. Check for your ability to find the book in the house. Okay, that's a 10 plus to a 12.
Okay, you find yourself in the bathroom,
and you're like, That's That's not right.
While I'm in there, I do go just cause I'm like, oh, well, I'm here, Might as well, And then he gets distracted for a moment looking around the room, then realizes he needs go find the book and then goes off.
Okay. Yeah. You go up
the staircase and there's a big, comfy looking bed with a bunch of embroidered pillows on it. And above the bed, there's a bunch of books you just grab three of thumb that look right. And bring those
whichever one's work semi green, all anything that could be considered green.
Yes. So you grabbed three books and front back outside, and you hand them to Lili. And she's like,
Oh, thank
you Know about this one. This here it is taming the growth, flora and fauna in the Yorty region and beyond. It's my book on I mean well, you can probably guess, Uh, yes, uh, Nuwa has a way with plants. They could just grow about just about anything. Um, so we've been teaming up for years, making a little catalogue as many plants as we confined. She like gestures at their extensive garden. Those air, most of the hardy plants.
What you say the name of this place was again? Oh, um, we're in North
Yorty. Okay, North. You already. Cody pulls out a notebook and write it down.
So get the
state your characters taking notes
e new words he didn't know And I think this one keeps
coming up. So he bought his notebook and one with his school notes. He Yeah, he literally writes down just that one name, no context.
Cody has just been told already by his parents that really needs to start prepping for the S A. T
s. Just like writing down every single new wordy. Here's God making flashcards. Uh, and she says, Yeah,
she actually, when you say that, she flips open the book to the first page and you can see a carefully like hand drawn map of the region So you can see on this map where there's a little clearing with the house and the dome and Lili points to die. It's like that's us and
all.
Covering the whole rest of the map are a bunch of little
placement pins, kind of think like circles of places and then writing next to them. The writing in the
book is in a language that you don't recognize. You can actually make out what any of the words say, and she's like, yes, So we we mapped out where all of the plants, like
around us grow. And then you can flip to the corresponding page number and she, like, flips to a page and you see, like this tree with these, like, always fruits hanging from it. And she's like And so
then you can
match up where we found the tree with details about it any, like, magical properties. It has any, like, healing properties, whether it's toxic,
all that
hands you the book.
That's amazing. Oh, my. Thank you. Um, many years, many
years of work. Um, and we both find it very relaxing.
Uh, if when I'm looking at this book, can I tell about how big of a region the map covers? Um, make an intelligence check. That is not a good role. That would be a five note.
You can't tell your guessing. Not very big, but that's kind of a much as you can get.
Okay. Hey, Cody, can I see that? No book for a second.
Uh, sure. And hands it over.
Erica. Kind of search, jotting down just the general landscape. Cool of the area and, like, where the houses and where the river is, um, like, can I see where the Blue Spurs is on the man? Yes. Okay,
Yeah. You follow the little stream down with your finger, and there's, like, a big circle there. And when you flip to that page is a drawing
of a big blue pine
Perfect. So I'm gonna be marking down those little landmarks just so, like, orientation wise, I kind of know where we're at and where we can go.
Actually, when Lili sees you doing that, she says, Oh, you might also enjoy this then And she she takes the map page and flips it to the next page. And there's like, a slightly zoomed out version, and you can see a general area like a little further out again. You can't breed any of the writing. She says, Oh, yes. Here's this is us here in North Yorty.
Um, and she like, trails her finger south a little bit, and she points to a region marked there, and
she says this used to be the town of Yordy. But it burned
down about, um,
20 years ago or so.
Um, and people didn't really want to rebuild it. Yeah, so we're right up here North. We still call it North Authority, even though nobody lives in your T.
Where did everyone move Teoh that used to live there. Oh, yes.
And Lili traces air fingered like further south on this, like zoomed out map
that there that town is fells. Keep. That's the nearest town that people still live in. So I believe most of
the people from your d moved down to fells keep or than kept going on. But she, like at this point, is like there's like a large river. And so she, like, traces down the coast of that to a big circle that is marked with a little
illustration of a castle. And she says, That's the capital Chechen.
Oh, perfect. Thank you
so much. This is really helpful. You're welcome. And Erica keeps scribbling and trying her best to do a decent copy of the map maker performance check.
Can Cody help by going into his backpack and handing over the colored pencils?
So I have, like, a key that I'm created. Yeah.
Good. Yeah, I'd say that's advantage.
Okay, that would be a 16. Awesome. Yeah. You make
a, like, a decent kind of crude, but like, at least like, spatially accurate recreation of these two maps. So you now have a map of the near region of North Authority and the larger region. Perfect.
Thank you
so much. Lili. This makes me feel a lot more grounded as to kind of where we are, because it's it's all very new and a little bit scary.
Oh, you're so welcome. It is
just great having you here. I
don't think you're in trouble. Why are you grounded? Oh, um, like, I have my feet on the ground like I know where I am. Oh, okay. He can write that down too. I'm grounded too. You're all grounded. Um, Erica. Erica writes down, grounded next to Yordy and writes down her best definition of it for Cody. Great. You two are starting your own dictionaries. Okay, let's
skip over to what Jasmin and Nicola are doing. So Jasmin Nuland lead you out of the
house on day two of you are walking quietly through their gardens and you reach the edge of the glass stone nuwa raises up their hand and places it on the panel of glass in front of you. And they say
I I think
you'll like it in here. You feel a slight little rumbling at your feet, and the glass panel in front of you slides into the ground, leaving a doorway into the dough.
Jasmin jumps a bit when it opens, but when she sees the insides, I
think she does visibly relax a bit. She was probably kind of hunched over, hugging herself. Yes, and now she she's still hugging herself, but she stands a bit
taller. Yes, when you went outside, teacup jumped out of your arms and went toe lay somewhere in the garden.
Yeah, you can now see into this dome, and inside
there are just must be hundreds of plants. They're
these long planter beds and stone shelves with potted plants and glass terrariums with very interesting things in them. Immediately to your left, there's this
large wooden table covered in papers and potted plants and gardening tools, and then through the middle of the dome, runs a stream, which you saw from outside, and it delivers some water to the
later beds. Go on
new, less says, and she like gestures. You inside. Go explore. Um, don't touch the ones marked with an X and she like, puts her hands up in like a X pattern, and then they pick up a watering can and start, just like moving through the shelves, tending to the plants. What
do you do?
I will probably hesitantly get inside, but then
kind of quickly get distracted by all of the different plans, just examining all of the ones that look like probably starting with something that looks near familiar and then going stranger and stranger until there's just the really weird plants and admiring them
all.
Yeah, they come in like every shape and color you can imagine. There's some that kind of remind you of
plants that you've seen before, like spider plants like tumbling out of, ah, hanging pot, you see, like some little trees that are planted in the planter beds,
all of the like fruit and vegetables, like the things that look like they could be edible are strange and weird colors, and we're spiky or glittery or something. But yeah, it's comforting.
Um, Lula.
Yeah, Newell is off, just like amongst the planter beds, checking some plants, but they see you come over and they say Yes, dear. What do you need?
I Thank you for letting me see these. Could you tell
me about some of them?
Oh, um,
I keep a lot of plants at home, but they're different from all of the's.
Yes. Uh, yes. Why don't we Why don't
we go on a little tour and new leads you down the rows of plants and they, like, point out which ones are are safe to eat. They point out a couple which are quite poisonous and say, like, make sure you, uh, don't touch touch these. Even Thea leaves will leave this fine powder on your fingers that will start seep in. And it has some very bad effects.
Do you keep these for medicine?
Yes. Um, well, mostly for research. Uh, we've been collecting as many different plants as we confined for decades now, and at some point decided that maybe we should start writing it down. So Lili does most of the writing, and I do most of just the tending to the plants, But we've got a pretty decent catalogue that, uh, we copy out and send down to fells. Keep in. They have someone there to make copies and kind of distribute information about plants of the kingdom.
That sounds like advice. Life,
it
is it ISS. We like it out here. A lot of people, we just really like the growth, you know, down in in the cities people they don't take too kindly to people who are different. Like so. Yeah, it's nice out here not having to deal with any of that are
a huge which one of few is difference to them.
Oh, um, I guess maybe you don't have this concept where you're from, but, um, in in general, uh, people who, uh, have mutations, I think is the long term Mutis. You know, um, subtle mutations are in fashion, you know, antlers, goblin tales, things that are cute. Um, but not so much people who look more like Lili does. Uh,
but she's really beautiful.
Oh, and this is the first time you've seen new, like, really relax, and they kind of like, look away for a moment, and then they turn back to you and they say Yes. Yes, she is it It really depends where
you go, and we don't travel too much. Lili's family lived out east and came out here and yeah, it it depends where you're from. I've heard
we we don't have the concept of the mutations or if he didn't but we where I'm from, we hate things and people that are different. Justus much. I might not look very different from any of the other people that worry came from, but still it's That's not That's not every way that you can be different, you know?
Yeah. Nuland nods and kind of looks back over the plants, and they like touch one of the brightly colored pink and purple like flowering plants on the alleged. And they say, I think that's why we like the plant so much. When you're when you're surrounded by by plants, everyone just celebrates how different and interesting they are. And variety is a good
thing. They don't judge you.
Yes, yes, they certainly don't.
I started keeping plant speakers. There's a lot of things I can't do. Okay, sometimes it seems like there are so many that the list of things that I can do is much shorter than the list of things that I can't do. But the plants I could keep them alive, even if I started with very easy, as they didn't care on. It felt like I was being useful to something living. At least
that's beautiful. I I really do that a lot. Um,
yes. Oh, So you a new let's spend some time
walking around the greenhouse and they show you a bunch of different plants and kind of teach you at least a
basic understanding of which ones are very dangerous and what to look out for and which ones have things you can eat. Do you have any specific questions about plants
you want them to answer?
Nothing specific about plants. Is there like a bench or something? Somewhere in this green orb?
Yes. There are actually multiple benches that you could sit on.
Okay, I imagine after
a while she would sit down on a bench and
after breathing in very deeply a couple times in trying to gather some semblance of bravery,
ask from everything that you told me. Why here? You not scared me. It's it sounded very
proud. It's not a it's, it's not a happy story. And, uh, and they kind of look at you. You're right. I'm worried that if I tell you that it will, it will be too hard to here. But if I don't tell you, it might happen. So I might as well tell you when I was very young, um, we lived in a town, actually not Not too far from fells. Keep a little, Just a village, Really. A couple dozen people banded together toe fend off the growth and carve out a little place of safety. And I had I had a brother. He was a few years younger than me. And though our mother had left when we were still very young, her dad was great. He was kind and loving and encourage. Adjust our love of plants and the outdoors will, making sure to keep us safe within the village walls and around 10 or 11 years old, when magic really starts toe to manifest, my brother started showing signs off shifting A shifter is a word that is thrown around and malice in fear. It means, ah, a person who can change their shape and their form and become beasts that they see in the wild in the growth. And my brother, just out of nowhere one day became he became fire lizard and I couldn't stop him, couldn't stop him from trampling through town and laying waste toe that bakery and the the nursery. Where and a to this point nuwa stop socking and just kind of stares out into the plants for a while and then they, like, shake their head and come back to it. They
What was his name?
Tyrone. I don't like his name anymore. The people of the village used him as a warning for a long time after that. But I've seen what changing conduce to somebody the way that you become something else and you lose who you were. He wasn't violent. He wasn't malicious. He wasn't reckless, even as a person. But once he changed, he was he just became something else, something that wanted to burn and stomp and thrash. And I'll save you the the gruesome ending. But he didn't make it. And so he became just another point on a list of reasons why shifters are evil and feared. I'm sorry. That's all right, dear.
What if I just only change into good things like mice and goblins? And I don't know she
the That's a good It's a good
thought from what little Tyrone told me about the feeling before he was gone, He said it was addicting. He said it was just It made him feel free and fulfilled, and he couldn't help himself.
Oh, I really don't want to get addicted to being a move. Shrooms.
Yes, exactly. Have you had any training for your magical, uh, affinity? No. No. Okay.
We were given magic by being attacked at being thrown into deadly situations and being tossed into pits and cut with sorts and sap to the fighting. And the magic appeared in response. I think nobody told us how to do any of it or what it waas.
Um, I've heard of places that do it like that.
I was spitting by a shark
who knew a kind of shutters at that. Really? I don't like the water. That sounds horrible. Why don't why don't we just talk about some plants so more?
Actually, here's Here's a fun little spell, and they take you over to
one of the planter beds and kneel down beside it, and it's like this big box full of soil and got some like trees in it, and they take you to a section that's relatively empty. So just fresh loamy soil and they say, Put your hands in the soil and they stick their own hands in the soil, OK, and then Nuwa leads you through a little breathing exercise. You feel your shaky hands calm a little bit in the safety of the soil, and they just keep guiding you and coaching you until you feel calm and at peace and your eyelids drift close. Then they nudge you with the robo, and when you open your eyes, a little bundle of flowers have brought it out of the earth around your fingers.
I think that this is the first time since being told the story of shifters being dangerous and after the response to her revelation in the house, that this not between her eyebrows is disappeared and she just smiles very brightly.
Wonderful. Let's go check in on Max Max. You're left
standing in the living room, holding a second cup of tea. Everyone else left. Cody briefly reappeared and ran through the room, not paying attention to you and then left with some books.
What do you dio?
Didn't you say really brought out a bunch of food?
Yes, there's a bunch of like things that look like chips and Cem dip. And these, like green orbs that Cody was gorging himself on. There is also a cauldron of stew, Just kind of, like, simmering over the fire.
Okay, well, Max just kind of awkwardly waved goodbye toe Eric and Cody as they left and then went back Teoh snacking on all the things he could find and walking around aimlessly. Just looking at all the things in the
victory is just eaten. Cool. Make a dexterity
saving through. Oh, okay, that's a 12. Yeah, plus nothing to 12.
Okay. Yeah, as you're like,
wandering around kind of like chopping these green orbs. You're carrying your like, long sword, which you've all just had Kind of like a mismatch of weapons this whole time And you never found a place toe? Carefully stow them. And as you're like looking at some pictures framed on the wall, you turn and your long sword just kind of like knocks a potted plant off a ledge and you try to catch it, but it falls and smashes.
Fuck, Shit! I'm gonna try to, like, scoop up all the pieces on get all the dirt off the floor and then just kind of look around the room to see if there's somewhere. Aiken, I can hide it.
Okay, make a get deception check.
That is a seven minus one.
You decide for
the remains of the potted plant into another potted plant, and as you're pouring it in there, it knocks that
put it, plan off also. And it's the floor and smashes.
Oh, no. Hey,
what are you doing? Uh, nothing. You turn around in
the small round, woman with antlers and a broken leg is standing in the doorway to one of the other rooms. And just like lowering at you.
What are you doing in here?
Nothing. I'm just Ah,
eating, you know? Okay, make another deception check.
That's Ah, 16.
Okay. She believes you, I guess. Duff. A bunch of crackers in your wrote really fast. Well, you're you're you're whatever how to use that thing.
She points at the long sword you've been dragging around. Ah, well, no, not really.
You're an embarrassment holding it like that.
Trash my house.
Lucky you haven't broken
anything yet. All right, let's go. Tough guy
Grabbed the swords off the mantel. Come on. And she points above the fireplace and you see a pair of crossed swords mounted up
there one long, one short and Windwards already limping out the door. Um, yeah. Oh, I'll grab the swords and follow her.
She leads you outside. You very easily catch up with her because she is much smaller than you and limping, and she leads you to a open patch of moss and then clearing near the house. There's like
a pile of mossy logs in the center, just like overgrown with vegetation. And when you get there, wind, Ridley sizes you up. And she says, I m
start with the long sword, not the the metal. What the normal Not that fairy shit you got.
And she pulls a stick of incense from her pocket and lights it with a match, then mutters something under her breath and drops the stick on the pile of
mossy logs. She shuffles backward quickly and sits on Iraq. The pile of logs twitches and then unfolds to a standing position and rooted in the ground in front of you. There is a wooden practice
dummy with a wooden sword in one hand and a shield on the other and winded sitting for on the rock says,
Go on, try to hit her.
Yeah, I'm not just gonna try to hit the dummy, I guess.
Okay, Great. I added a metal short sword to your character sheet, and then you don't have proficiency with that. So
go ahead and try that.
Okay, that is 17.
Yeah,
OK, so you you rear back with this metal sword, and it's awkward and you're kind of to hand bring it down and slap it right onto the dummy, and it hits. But you notice that you hit it with the flat side of the sword, not the sharp side. And Windwards just starts laughing at you.
That rings the sword like a lot. And it kind of stings my hands. Eso I almost dropped the sword. Yeah,
you look sad and like an embarrassing that it's like,
No, not like that.
And she kind of, like, beckons you over to her where she's sitting on the rock.
I'll shake my hands a little bit and then walk over to her.
Yeah, 100. Just like she's got like, it just such a grumpy face on. But she's still kind of laughing and she like, adjusts year grip on this ward and then starts whacking you in the leg. And she's like,
move this one over here. Okay, Try again.
Okay, That is a six.
Oh, you're so embarrassed that you try to do the things she says, but you just bring it down.
And the practice dummy brings up the shield and, like, effortlessly blocks your sword out of the way and winters like
No, no, no. Stop trying
to smash her. You're not going to get anywhere like that. You need to pay attention to what she's doing. And she points to this practice, dummy. See? Wait for her to make a mistake, and then you can strike. OK? Do you
get it?
I think so.
Okay, good. Do it again. So go ahead and roll another attack. That's not 20.
Oh, shit. All right, Max, with all of your big buff boy
training that you've had in your life, you take a breath and wait for the practice, dummy, to kind of bring up its sword as though it was going to attack you and you slam it right underneath. You would have a big dent in this wood, and it kind of like, splits off some splinters and win drones like, huh? Nice. All right, maybe you're not a loss cost. OK, uh, let's try it again. But this time you could do some blocking. And as you're standing there with your sword, kind of like, jammed into the practice stomach side. It takes a swing at you and gets a 13 that
will hit me without the shield,
OK? Yeah. Yeah. You don't have the shield. You've just got the sword. Um, and it brings it soared up and under and then kind of just, like, wax you in the ribs
and you take one point of damage. It's not a sharp soared. It just kind of smarts. A little bit win. Drin says,
Come on, you gotta pay attention. Can you pay attention
out? Uh, yeah, I
think I can. All right, this
time. Move out of the way. Dumb ass on. Then it swings again and gets a 13
the same thing
and it hits. You get any sick? 1 40 of damage on 100 says better. That was better.
What's gonna
die? Died training and wondered
coaches You through doing
this for a while? Um, she teaches you a little bit more about how to handle the sword and how to bring it down in the right way. And actually dodge when something else comes to hit it, you
not just stand there like a big piece of meat. And then she stopped you into those are all right. All right. You You've mostly caught it. You're actually whatever. I could still kick your ass if my Dan leg was healed. You need to practice against a person. What? That little shit go starts looking around on. She spots Zan over in the trees, and she is
Hey! Hey, you get over here. What?
Windrow looks at you. Maxim is like, Go care going now.
Uh, Okay, You got it, Coach Maxes Max is gonna get a runoff. Try and get their to come over.
All right? Yeah. You finds in
a little bit into the woods.
Hey, uh, you know that that grumpy old lady that we met earlier? Yes. She's teaching me how to use a sword. You should You should totally come learn how to use the sword. It's, like, really fun. Ah, she's fine.
Come on. Your chicken,
You know? Yeah, She is kind of grumpy.
No, I'm not chicken. You're a jerk.
But she's like she's, like, a really good coach.
Come over here and fight me, then. I'm not gonna fight an old lady Fight. My were practice doubly. Yeah, I'm not gonna fight your pile of sticks either. That's stupid because she could kick your ass. Ah, fine.
Zan walks back over with Max. Nice job bags, this job. All right, Uh,
get dropped the fairy shit. Take
this and she holds out a metal short sword to use them. Okay, try to hit him and she nods it. Max Zan has, like, a simple slow smile sort of creep over her face like you want me to hit
him? Yeah,
Max has Max has, like, a big, dumb smile on his face. It is. It is in, like, a ready stance, but the sort out in front of them.
Okay, go ahead and roll in. Attack
is going to go very badly yet you can use your short sword, but with not proficiency.
That's
Ah 14. The hit Uh yes, ha, yeah. Alright. Zan goes to swing at you and then jolts the other way and just slaps you into the in the ribs with, um, little sort. You take one point of damage. The sword is completely dull. And eso it doesn't hurt that bad win. Drood says Yeah, she is better than you. All right.
Yeah. Uh uh Hit Iraq.
Okay, that is a 20 not natural, just total.
But now that doesn't hit. That's a no No. Uh, no, he absolutely does hit.
Yeah, Zan you're in close for that hit on Max's side and you realize a little too late that you are way too close. And even as you try to, like, scramble backwards, he brings down the sword and just kind of, like, wax you in the arm. I'll take one point of damage. The rest of you, Cody, Erica and I
think
even Jasmin from inside the dome can now definitely hear the sound of two people fighting.
Can we see them where they are? Or is it just hearing
you? Actually, Cody and Erica, you can probably kind of see them from where you are.
Uh, Cody immediately looks over, sees his two friends fighting and yelling, looked at Eric and says fighting and then just takes off running towards them. So you just running across the
field like Hey, stop it! Hey, don't What? Why? Okay, Theo concerned. 12 year old is running towards you, Cody, As you get closer, you see, these two thes do idiots are laughing and
smiling at each other on Daisann is getting ready Teoh Max with her sword again. So go ahead and roll in.
That's
another 14. All right? Great. Yeah. You take that hit. And you kind of
like, shrug your arm off a little bit
and then
come back in and hit about the other
side fax. You take one point of damage, we fucking suck it blocking
e o
like you know I don't have a shield equipped.
Yeah, like we don't have any blocking mechanic. I don't know, impressing B
button. Lili kind of sees Cody runoff, and she goes, Oh, no. And she's, like, finished the laundry and just fold it all up and picks it up. And then she she actually turns to you, Eric, and she's like, Oh, it's here, sweetheart. Here's your, um,
suit back. Is that what you called the jumping suit? Yeah. Yeah, thank
you so much. And, um, Erica is trying to pick up like Cody's backpack and his notebook. And like the books will also tryingto keep this robe wrapped around her and also carry the jumpsuit. And it's just like the most awkward mess you've ever seen. A beautiful
I think Jasmin appears in the door of the class thing, and just like, half of her is covered in dart like her hands are covered in dirt and, like her knees are covered in dirt. Yeah, she just looks out at everyone fighting.
It is a little dirt monster. Jasmin. You see that Max and Zan are engaged in a sword fight, and Cody is trying to stop them.
Come on, dude Brow. Give me what you've got A great max rocket attack.
Do you? That's Ah, 10
fit. That's what Zan yells Can't touch this a Zmax differences sort around. T jumps out of the way yelling can't touch this.
Cody finally has made it up to this scene after running across the yard. And he's not gonna get between them cause they're sorts. And he's Yeah, he's child, but not that stupid. Um, he he get close to many, just he stops, He put his hand on his knees and he's out of breath, goes
I don't know who said what stupid thing to make this happen. But since really, why?
Zan points at win, dread
goes, um,
100 looks at Cody and she's like,
Yeah, come on, sit down, watch the show What?
Max looks a code. And he's like,
Oh, hey, are you Are
you here to learn how to sword fight, too? It's like it's like, so much fun.
No, we're not gonna teach the small child how to use a sword. I shoot magic. I'm good. Yeah, and he's got a stick.
And so he sits down wherever he was told to sit down and just just trying to figure out what is happening right now.
Jasmin will sit down next to Cody, just pat him on the shoulder, leave a whole bunch of dirt on the shoulder,
Erica, slowly stumbling up, up.
Teoh still think like what was happening in
her giant bathroom? Yeah, wintered pauses the both of you for a minute and kind of like, corrects both of your posture. Dan. When wind rid brings you over And like, changes where your hand is holding the sort do you like? Listen
to her. Ah, yeah. I think
Zanzi relaxed enough since she got to get some hits in. Yeah, that she's, like, kind of like, I think she should. She like putting on a bit of a show of like, Oh, come on now. I can do this by myself, but like, but she shoe will sort of lesson. She'll do it. Okay, great.
She knows that she's
literally never used a sword before. Great. Okay, yeah. 100. Adjust your grip and like, shows you where toe like how toe change your stance to get a little more weight behind your swings. And then she whispers to you, He's not guarding his left side. Go get him, Tiger. And
like that, I think it's Zandt's turn again. Yeah,
because of the last thing I shatter was Can't
touch this. Ah, that's an eight I heard Now, with the weight of everyone watching you run forward and then trip a little bit. Kind of like head, but the in the chest doesn't hurt. It's awkward. Ah, Max, are you Are you still going? Yeah. All right. Go for it.
That's Ah, nine.
Right. Uh, you're laughing so hard, it sands with you tryto smart around you. Just you also You just miss completely. Wow. Such shit. Yeah.
He looks up at Jasmin. If
they're gonna fight, really should try to do something good.
They're doing better than I could.
True,
You know, they gave me a sort. Don't know who would give me a sword who thinks that's a good idea. At least they look like they could use it.
They gave me 1/4 of a staff which, like, asked me a really long staff. Don't give me 1/4 of it and still be as tall as
me.
That is strange.
Three of you kind of hang out as maxims and feed on each other. They're having a great time. And then you hear a kind of like, low
rumble. And Lili had gone back in the house toe, put the washing away. And I assume actually, Erica went and get got changed.
Yeah, I I went and got changed as soon as I got back to the house.
Great. Yeah. You're in your jumpsuit again. You can now move your arms and legs freely without the bathroom check.
I should have been doing bathroom checks. Honestly, Yeah, and then you hear a roar.
What? It's
a loud, guttural sound and crashing out of the bushes is a giant, rocky beast of some sort. What? It's on four legs. It's a least 12 feet tall at the shoulder and covered in moss analogy and dripping with gunk. And then it opens its gaping maw. Again. You realize that it's not yelling. It's just the sound of two rocks grating against each other. And it reads down over you. This giant rocky quarter pet Gollum lunges towards you.

Yeah, Thanks, guys. For listening again and enjoy the rest of the
show. Yeah, have fun. Bye. Roll for initiative. Oh, dear. I get to roll twice because that's the new Ranger thing is apparently, get through a joint initiative. Uh, the it's a 11. Anyway, though, if I forget
18 for me,
I got the 14 minus one. So 13
Okay. 15 12 for Cody and Lili eyes just like
Oh, no. Um oh, no. Can you can You will handle this, Are you? Is this I? I'm such a bad hostess, but could you handle this on?
She's like looking at you.
Wow. I just And Lili kind
of looks at all of you and then scoops up wind Rid who has a cast on one leg and windows like
No. And when Lili's like
and runs back to the house, uh, with wind rid under her arm, first up is Erica.
Okay. Um I am going to cast Earth Tremor
Woo. Alright, tell me what Earth termer does.
So each creature in area other than you takes one d six bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. It's a dexterity safe
dexterity save all right
for 1/2 damage and to avoid prone. But they'll take damage no matter what.
All right, great. Okay. This towering rocky Gollum is lumbering towards you and you watches Erica flips through her menu and presses Earth tremor in Erica on your screen. It pops up with the notification that says Singh.
Oh, shit. Saying, Oh, no, I should never have been a Bard. Oh, well, OK, yeah. So Erica goes, let's
get it started, huh? And then, like that's when the hammer hits the ground
around you just shakes. And underneath this stone Gollum, it erupts in just like a the ground, almost just like rules and the Gollum who's going to try to remain on its feet? It got a
15 versus your spell. Save gets 11 so saves, but it will still take half damage. All right, rule damage. That is a six. So three.
Great. Yeah, this thing stumbles a bit but stays
standing and lets out another of those grinding yell. Next up is Max.
Ah, great question. Yes, I know. I could use my bardic inspiration. Could I do that really quick? Yes. Yeah,
you can use that as a bonus
action. So I yell to Max. Max, you're going to do a great job. And I give Max, uh, a point of bardic inspiration.
You know, have a d six
that you can add to any d 20 role. And you don't have Teoh do it until you have
decided you want to. Nice Max. You were holding a metal long sword, but your fancy summoned one is just like at your feet, so you could easily pick it up and switch if you wanted to.
Okay, Um, and my
robot, your chairs so squeaky you have to remain completely still will talk.
The Saudia using right now is blunt, right?
Max isn't thinking about that, Max is just didn't go in
so dumb. Yeah, you all
watch. Max just runs towards this giant stone Gollum with his metal sword and swings it right down into one of its legs. Go ahead and roll in attack.
If that is 12 who do
not hit your sword just like effortlessly slides over one of these rocks. And you're just standing very close to the big Gollum. Now,
X, you dumb ass. That's a practice sword. Uh, next up is Jasmin.
How far away from the goblin? A, my right now. Oh, the goblin got Gollum. Sorry it
got away from the gold
amount. Look, Jasmin always just needs to know how far she is from that cat
e. I
have my priorities straight. Anyway. How far away for every from this college? Gullible teacup
kind of like sees this happening. And he was lying outside in the sun and he liked twirls between your legs and then just kind of, like, trots off into the distance. You're probably 40 feet from the big Gollum.
What? I theoretically be able to get within 15 feet at such an angle that I could hit the Gollum, but not Max with an A we spell.
Yes.
Yes, I think so.
Okay, then I think Jasmin kind of runs towards the side of where Max and the Gollum are and aims a bit to the right and presses thunder wave and then just kind of stops on the ground, I guess with one feet. So thunder way creatures, an area that Faillace save, which is a Constitution save. Take duty eight thunder damage and are pushed 10 feet away from you. Half damage on save and are not
this very constitute. Gollum gets a 17 much constitute. Wow. Yes.
Yeah, I expected him to save, but still, it's a seven plus five, which is 12 6 Thunder damage.
Yeah, out of just, like, emanating in front of Jasmin. The air kind of smacks forward and hits the God the Gollum who hears back and lets out another of those upsetting, grinding yells. Next up is Cody. Okay,
Um, how far? My from the goal
within, like, 20 or 30 feet.
Is there anybody in between me and the goal
in, like, a direct line? I'd say Probably. Max is,
uh, he's gonna step forward, Just kind of in a move of just battle. Ready? Not really necessary. He takes one step forward. Yep. He thinks needs to and holds out one of his. His card has a little yellow tent to it, and he he's like, Max duck. Anything. A shoot magic missile at the at the goal
you own. No, no. Um, Max make a
dexterity saving throw. Oh, boy, that's Ah, 13.
All right, Max kind of turns
around is like, huh? Oh, and then leans over a little
bit. It didn't matter either way to see if I was able to do it. I'm a
fan. Okay, here we go. Three D four. That is a 437 and a 5 12
Damn. Yeah. These beams of pink and yellow light just stream out of Cody's outstretched hand and slam into the Gollum, hitting it left, right, left and little like pieces of stone shower off to the sides
and the gollum yells again
because that's basically all the Gollum does is yell. And it rolled a really bad initiative. So it's sands turn. Oh, Brad, I am going to take my ethereal short sword. Great. You dropped the practice sword. Pick up your fancy one. Yeah, and I'm gonna run and try to hit it. Rolling attack. That's a 14. And I have advantage because I'm a ranger and it hasn't gone yet. Nice. That's still a 14 plus two. So 16. 16. Yeah, that hits. Yeah. You dig your short sword into one of its mossy joints between two rocks and give a good slash. All right, go ahead and roll damage. That is six plus two. Slashing damage for eight. Slashing. Dammit! Jim! Yeah. You rip out some of the gun keeping its rocks together. It looks the same because it doesn't really have a face. It's made of rocks. This is exactly what I needed today. I don't think I need to describe its reaction on each turn, but it
yells again. What do you want? You said it sounds like rocks
rubbing together, right?
Yeah, it's unpleasant for everybody. Just sort of do like all you look in its mouth and is just filled with dice. I think
the rocky Gollum rears back and then brings one of its hands down trying to slam right into Zan because it doesn't have a very long memory and she just hit it. It gets a 16 to hit.
Yeah, that's gonna hit.
Zambezi is within five feet of me. Yes, I will give the monster disadvantage on that attack. Do you have a shield? I don't I don't have it. Shit! Fuck you
Try to throw your meat body in the way and it doesn't nothing and Zan gets hit for eight bludgeoning damage.
Julie. Shit! Alright, how Zan looking? Well, let's just say Zan hasn't healed since the move. Shrooms fight, So not amazing. What? What's all right? Uh
how is son? Looking on the scale of 1 to 17 or 18?
Ah, on a scale from 1 to 18 she looks looks about a five wolf. That's not good. And it's Erica's
turn again. Okay, Erica, you've just watched his Gollum kind of crush stand a little bit.
I'm fine,
Erica is Ah going to cast healing word on Sam Zan I'm putting on my faith
in new because Max already failed us. I feel much better now. Oh, my God! I feel amazing. Okay, so that is to nothing, I'm gonna say, just from dungeon
Master reverence for your amazing song. She gets double
that Great. So four
ran. Next up is Max's turn as a free action like all of you are allowed to talk to each other like that doesn't take up your turn.
So has everybody doing way Think these ventures going
pretty good? It doesn't seem.
I mean, you could help out the big meat for Max. Use your fucking sword,
Cody, Just stands there pointing at it. Max realizes that this sort is kind of a shit and throws it away, clicks his wrist together and hits the button for both his sword and shield.
Yes, my genius boy, who's not going to take an attack of opportunity trying to go get his other sword. I love him. Do what you want
as a bonus action. I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on myself.
Max goes into his menu, and now he's glowing the glittering not like full jumpsuit glowing,
but tha on.
And then I'm going to hit
it. Oh, nice, great. That's a one. All right, after all of it. ISS amazing menu work. Max rears back, and he's just
he's way over thinking it. He's like, All right, yeah, I got to put my foot here And then I make sure to adjust. Make Oh,
no, I didn't learn one handed grip. And then
he clunks his sword into E Gollum's big rocky leg, and it bounces back and hits him in the head Max to take one point of damage because you yourself with your own sort, is a very good turn. Those CD. Okay? Just
okay. Jasmin is going. Teoh back up about 15 feet and she is going to summon her. She ordered sword gas. Yes, and then she is going. Teoh, stick the sold into the ground than point with her sword hand at then and used balm of the summer core, Which means I can give you a T.
Wait. Why do you get the sword? She wanted to look cool. Shut up!
Okay, you'll get three hit points. Listen,
rad. Listen, I don't have
that many hit points, so this is pretty good. Everyone else sees a couple flowers, bloom and sands hair.
Oh, and you feel better. Are you looking at us?
And then she is going to hold up her right hand again. And someone a ball of flame. I'm throw it up. The culo. Nice Rowley. Ranged Attack. Do produce flame produce. Blame
Max. It it The max votes
will attack bonuses plus five. That would be a 13 total.
13 unfortunately, does not hit. Okay, SuZanne, you feel better. And then you kind of go what? And move to the side as a ball of flame shoots past you.
Uh, sorry. We see. Didn't hit May 1st, my head itchy. It is Cody's turn.
Well, Cody's look down in his car and go a little stinker. You worked
last time. Let's do it again. Magic missile. Well, stinker.
That's a 45 11. More beams of beautiful pink and yellow light shoot out of Cody's hand and slam into this column and couple more chunks of rock fly
off. Oh, how much this guy take. Jeez, it is Dance turn. I'm gonna hit it again. Nice. Yeah,
I thought that Be cool. That's a nine. All right. Yet you were just blasted by a bunch of different energy. And you feel better, but also a little disoriented and now have a lot of pressure because Max is failing so bad. And you bring your sword up and you hit it into the rock part of the Gollum. Go.
Ah, cod swords are just not great against rocks, huh? Note? Maybe you need a mother one. I only have this. You can have my sword. I'm not proficient in dual wielding their medic giving. All right? Next up is
the gollum, and it kind of like shrugs off these attacks
from Zan and Max that have been missing and
it's going to lumber forward and try to hit the kid who's been blasting it with magic. So who both Zan and Max get to take an attack
of opportunity on the Gollum?
That's
a six. So 16 nice Zan whiffs, but Max is able to connect
and go ahead and roll damage.
That's ah for damage.
All right? Yeah, You
scrape it a little bit as it lumbers by and the Gollum is going to, I guess, stomp right up to Cody and try to just smack you with one of its big rocky arm on and it rolls
back. The boy A It gets a nine it Mrs Ho Cody's just so small. It kind of goes
where brings up its hand and goofs it into the ground like two feet away from Cody. And it's now Erica's turn the call of the standing right over to the small child.
Erica is looking at her menu disappointed because all of her spell slots are checked and she's a oval and she equips her rapier. Okay. And Eric is gonna go for a stab because she doesn't really know what else to dio. All right,
Yeah. You run up to this dome and go for a stab stab,
And that's a nine
you put you poke it with this with shiny sword. It doesn't do anything
because, like, this is where just sing four thing. Okay, Next is Max's
turn. The Gollum just fucked off.
Um, I'm just gonna chase after it and continue attempting to beat the shot of it
All right now, I think you would get advantage because it for flanking
Yes, you run up to the Gollum's, but and so you're flanking it. You can roll with advantage.
The highest one was
a 10. If that does not hit, you get so rage matted. It's but But you just kind of smack it. And it's a big rock and it does nothing. It sucks. Yep, You feel dumb. But at least most people can't see you because they're on the other side of the Big Rock. Thanks. Dan saw you. It's Jasmin's turn.
Hey, somebody hit me with a fireball or something. But why? So that I can use my absorb elements and then use that against it? Oh, sure, Yeah. They're feels this fire even work that great on rocks. I know Somebody Take me with a water damage. No, that's not a thing. Cold damage, a music. Pokemon types. Here. I'll try. I'm gonna try and love a flea. All right. Plus five. That hits. Yeah, it's alright. Checked average resistance means
I take half damage, right? Yes, right. One p eight. Rollo. Erica Hill's
I just You you I
rolled up. What?
All right, So I think you take one
damage, all right? And absorb elements. So that
actually went is Barrows. Well, a kids, it could go. Yeah, I'm great at this.
I think Jasmin is just really scared of hurting. Just like a society flame. Like a like a Campbell. Flitting,
smoking slightly, but, like, gets two thumbs up. Yeah. You actually see what looked like flames flickering around sands hand where she's holding her sword. It is Cody's turn. The Gollum is basically on top of you.
Yes, I would like a coating to disengage. Uses kid like speed toe stealth like sneak between its legs and get away from the creature. Which I think I could go 45
feet. Cody just is bucket God. Kobe says, look this and then runs genius lakes and runs a classic
clearing. He doesn't swear he's a small child, but Cody's very safe now. It is Zant's turn.
All right, I'm gonna hit it again. Do it. Um, are we still flanking it? Yes.
If you run up to it, you will be flanking it. Great. Uh, that's a 13.
That does not hit. Son of a bitch. One of these days, I'm
going to be able to use
my stupid absorb elements spell. Does
it go away now?
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, it does. Zan kind of like clangs air soared into the rocks and some fire kind of goes like
you,
but it doesn't do anything.
Uh, that looked really cool.
I'm so sorry, baby. Thanks. You did look really cool. My hair still on fire. No. Great. You actually run your hand through your hair and you come back with a handful of flowers. What the fuck? All right, now it's the goal of Stern. The Gollum, I think, is facing Erica. So it's going to try to stomp on her love that for me. And it got a 20
one. You love to see it. That's an
after great. And it does. How many have points to you? How 16
baby. All right.
That's Yeah, it does. Um, 6 16 Teoh. It was nice knowing, You know, the Gollum lets out
another screeching pseudo scream and brings its hand down and just thrives Erica into the dirt and she is flattened. They're not, like, literally flattened but prone. And it brings its hand back up, and she does not move. Oh, my God. Next up is Erica's turn. So I'm gonna need you to roll the very first
death save. That's a four, baby. I Oh, keep track of that.
They you have one failure. All right? For
anyone listening. She gets to roll a d 20 on her turn. And if she gets below a 10 she has failed. And if she gets three failed, she dies for riel. In real life,
it's really
exciting that Eric is only gonna be in three episodes.
Next up is Max's
turn. Okay. Max watches the Gollum stop on Erica in his sulking from his previous failures and is gonna go run over to Erica and I will Yeah, I'll dump all 10 points of lay hands in Erica.
Oh, shit. All right, So you see Max, rotate around the column to the other side where Erica is and just drop is his long sword and put both of his hands just like right on her chest. And a brilliant bursts of pink and purple energy just flows out of him into Erica and Erica. You are healed for 10 hit points and you wake up with the gas.
Oh, Max. Oh, I'm really sorry that, uh, he said you screwed up. Thanks, Bud. How many times am I gonna die next
is Jasmin's turn,
which has been kind of looks around in a panic. How does how does the Gollum look?
Not great. So it's a bunch of boulders that air, like, held together by this, like like in, Or Moss. Um and, uh, it's kind of limping, so it doesn't look awesome, but it's still standing. Okay, Always dry fireballing me again.
I, uh No, I think Buck and Jasmin is going to run towards it, and I think Jasmin is going to try another another thunder wave. So another con se from the big boy. Please.
Great. You have to aim it. So you're either going to hit Zan
or Erica and Max
is thunder element.
It is an element, Right? So hit with Theo in the Gollum were rolling. Constitution saves.
Yes, Constitution.
It got a four. So it does not save. I got a 10.
My spell D C is 13. So neither if you save I am sorry for damage I am about to inflict on you. That would be I didn't roll to Well, I do six thunder damage and both are knocked 10 feet away from me.
Oh, great. So you kind of scoot them both
backwards in a blast of sound that comes out of you, Erica and Max, You're now out of, like, Maley range of the column on, and it's just kind of shakes itself off. And as it does that a couple of the boulders just kind of fall loose off of it, got its rocks off, and then no, it is.
Have you been waiting this whole episode for that one con? No, I just thought
of it. Very start and good. Very proud of you. Thank
you. Cold. It rocked Code Eastern.
So the moment that the Golden had smashed Erica, he had basically, like, any animated character that turned turns around screens and like the tears. Kind of like fly off the sides. And he screamed like, bloody kid murder. Wow. Like No. Like, he ran away. And then that happened. And so he is angry. Not again in the chute. Right. Frost at the Gollum
making. Arranged a sack 18. Nice. Yeah. You hit it squarely in its nasty, rocky jaw roll damage. That's
five. And its speed is reduced by 10 feet. All
right, Yeah, just more rocks. Go flying. It basically doesn't have a jaw anymore. It is unable to let out that rumbly scream. And it is Zant's turn. All right, come on. Did you absorb elements? Yeah, I'm gonna hit it. Hit it. Really Try to hit it this time. For real. These
That's a net 20 plus two. I think
that means that the damage you get from absorb elements is also double. Because all the dicer told.
Yeah, I rolled a three. So that six plus two is eight for the normal damage. Uh, and then it's one g six. That's another three sets. Another six. So that's eight damage and then 600 damage. Uh, Zin,
how do you want to do this? Yeah, uh,
Zan picks herself up off the ground after having been thrown away by the initial thunder wave and holds her sword in one hand and runs back up towards this stupid rock pile and then just jumps and, like, jabs it into the highest part of this monster that she can. And as soon as it hits, there's this wave of sort of sparks. Ah, that ripples through the monster and it collapses into just a pile of rocks on the ground. Nice Zana's perched up top like monster hunter style
Did it at the uh yes, I finally got to use it
and lilies in the doorway like,
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. What do we
got? And window? It's like,
yeah. Did you see that was read?
Cody runs back to check on
Erica. Erica, are you okay?
Yeah, I surprisingly feel a lot better than I did. You know, a few seconds ago. Thank you. Mex
um Jasmin also runs up and holds out her hand and casts good Berry just starts Starts like offering

Nuwa is hovering over Jasmin shoulder and is like, What are those?
You can have one nuwa. It says they're good Berries. She
takes the very and Lynn runs
off into the dome. Very excited. Max is gonna take one, and then, uh, just shove it in his mouth and then walk over to Zan and be like this was a really good training session. Can we Can we be like, training bro's now,
Buck? Yes. This is the best day so far,
Buck. Yeah, and then he's gonna hold his hand out for for what you assume is a fist bump.
Zan has to, like,
jump down off of this monster to fist bump. But she does. Nice. Fucking good.
Cody looks up a Jasmin. Um, Eric, you can have my Berries and walks off to conserve on the bench with his backpack and just kind of has a moment to collect himself.
Okay, What I could really use is maybe a nap.
What? Please, just eat all of these Berries first.
OK, I will eat these Berries. Open your mouth with Just like unhinge is like a pez dispenser. Deliveries fallen.
Jasmin is just stuffing Erica's about with Berries.
That's so one specific kink. So let's see. Oh, I'm sorry. It was a beautiful moment. Sorry. So the sky has
been overcast for most of the day, and at this point, you start to feel a couple drops of rain, and then the world goes dark for a second year in pitch black darkness, and
then everything returns to normal.
And Lili looks up the sky and sighs and says,
Oh, I guess we were due for more rain. Wait, Where with that,
and then you hear another low rumble from the woods behind you. But this time you recognize it is thunder, but movies, The black thing. The dark
name
For what? The dark name. The
things just now Where? God, All black. Oh, um, sorry. I keep forgetting about your amnesia. That was darkening. It happens.
Um, when it's, like about to rain. Ah, and then it happens. And then you
wait a few seconds
on Ben, you hear
thunder. And actually, oh, if you count how many seconds
it is between the darkening and the thunder, you can tell
how far apart the rain is. Isn't that neat? Okay,
I I don't know. It's
like lightning, but dark. Ah. Ah. Good moment for the bro's. Yeah.
Can we Can we go
inside? Yes. Yes.
Lili kind of shepherds you inside.
Come on, let's get inside
before it for we get soaked again.
Yes. Uh, Erica, do
you need help? I'm actually feeling great. Those Berries. Air wild. I don't know if they've got, like, biking in a member.
What? Like I'm feeling great. There's good Berries. I I
don't know. I just I just kind of make them I don't know what
their This This world doesn't have an opioid crisis. They have a good berry crisis. E
do now You just on a street
corner And there's like, this, like, wizened old man with a beard. And he opens his Jack, and he's like, You want the good
barest tomorrow? Eric is like Jasmin. Jasmin. I need the good Perry.
Give me a hit. Then
we dio for like, the next episode was It's like a time skip to, like, several months from now. And Jasmin is a
drug dealer. Three
important part is Erica is fully healed. I almost died, and now I'm fully healed.
Yeah. Yeah, You're on a roller coaster of hit points today, So the five of you and your three hosts make your way into the house again. It's It's getting kind of dark route.
When we start going back inside, Max is gonna remember something very quickly. Run back. Go pick up both of the abandoned trading swords. Good. Put him back wherever windrow got them from. Yes, and then look over it. Wind rid and give her, like, a a big thumbs up.
She she tries to remain grumpy, but
is like thank you. Okay, Goodbye. And she likes stops upstairs.
Hey, wasn't there another flowerpot over here? I think
there were two, actually,
uh, nap. Cody finds a corner of the room that's kind of, you know, cozy and sits down with this drawing supplies and just starts drawing and hasn't maybe lights up a card toe, give him some light, and he's just kind of decompressing in his own little way.
Nice. Yeah. Lili lets out
a big yawn and you can see through the windows that, like,
it's getting
dark outside and probably about nighttime. And Willie says,
Oh, um, I think I'm ready for bed. You you You're going to stay right?
And she looks very, very eager. Please,
I like Teoh.
Oh, wonderful. That would be great. Okay, okay, okay. I'm so sorry. Houses and bigger. You'll be all right out here, though, um, in the living room, the fire will keep you nice and warm and let me go get you some
blankets. And she goes out of the room and comes back holding probably like 15 blankets and pillows of various sizes. And she puts thumb on the floor, and then she reaches down and picks up the coffee table, which is like this. Like it
kind of looks
like someone like Cut down a tree. And so it's got, like the rings and stuff on the top. She was picks it up with one hand and kind of tucks it behind the coach. She's extremely strong.
Yeah, Max's awed by this
nice, vaguely turned on That is odd in a different
kind of way. Lower down and Lili starts like arranging these blankets into, like, like, makeshift little beds. And she's like,
Okay, um, uh, you'll you'll be good here.
Yes, I will keep the fired going overnight. It'll just keep going. It's, uh it's I made It is just it just keeps going.
Um, okay, we'll be right upstairs. If you need anything at all. Do you need
anything, uh, more blankets? And then
she goes off into another room and she comes back with probably, like, eight more blankets and pillows and actually start struggling, finding places to put them because she's brought so many blankets, she's made up three beds on the floor and then has kind of like reclined the armchair into a bed and then made a bed on the couch. And she's like, Okay, okay. Should
that be all this problem? Oh, I know. 40 and she goes and comes back Some help balancing five mugs of
tea which she pushes into each of your hands. This is for you. This is for you. This is free. And this one's for Cody. I made it with lots of sugar. There's also more sugar in the kitchen if you need some. Um, obviously, we don't have any milk way out here, but, uh,
do you need anything else?
I think we're good. Thank you.
Ok, well, just here. Do you have another
one of those little green Globe things for my rat? Oh, yes, of course. And she runs back into the kitchen, comes back with a basket of a probe, 30 of them and just, like, sets it like on your lap. And she's like, Is
this how many rat eats that stuff? Just take a many as you
want. Put them back in the kitchen when you're done. Okay. Okay. And she says
good night tonight
on heads upstairs. And so the five of you are now in your cozy little makeshift beds. Which bed did everybody take? I
thought we were gonna have to fight over who were making take the couch and chair
Cody was sitting wherever in whatever corner he found, where he's drawing. And I mean, really put a blanket around him while he was throwing. And he is going to not on purpose, but fall asleep mid drawing in that corner. Not on a bed,
Max. Execute you. Help me. But Cody off the couch.
Yeah, uh, Mexico over And as gently as he can pick up Cody, deposit him on the couch.
Jasmin. It would have walked along. Like intending to help with the max. Just picks Cody up without problems. Just uselessly.
Okay. Cody's now tucked in on the couch.
Maybe
Erica just lays down in front of the fireplace.
A sad Do you want to take the the chair? You could pretty
hurt. Oh, no, I can't. I can't sleep sitting up. I'll take the floor. Oh, it's reclined. Don't worry, it's flat. No, it's fine. I'll take the floor anyway. Uh, Zan finds, like, somewhere closer to
the door. Uh, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna look at Jasmin.

Are you sure? Yeah. OK, So Maxwell laid out on the chair.
This chair is
actually very large and you fit comfortably up on there.
Erica leans over to Jasmin and whispers. Thanks again, You're
welcome.
It's been a long day. You all cuddle up
into your blankets, many of them, and you feel warm and safe. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and between the crackling of the fire and the gentle drumming a rain on the roof, you easily drift off to sleep in the strange little house in the
woods, you can find us on Twitter.
