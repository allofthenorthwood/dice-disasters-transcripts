Yesterday, you stumbled across the family in the woods-- Lili, the bubbly half-goat woman; Nula, the quiet human; and Windred, the grumpy lady with antlers. After spending the day together, they invited you into their warm little living room to spend the night. The first light of dawn trickles into the house in the woods. Cody sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket. He's coloring in his notebook to pass the time until his friends wake up. On the floor at his feet, Erica is curled under a blanket with Jasmin's arm flung over her waist. Their breathing is slow and even. A comfortable sound, after the trying events of the last few days.\nOliver: Cody, you hear a rustling in the pile of blankets by the door and watch as Zan kicks off her covers and groans. Zan, you wake up too hot. You feel like you're a mile underground, fighting to breathe. This room is too small, the walls are too thick.\nOliver: Cody and Zan, what do you do?\n=== INTRO THEME: “Elysia” by People Need Goals ===\nAlan: Cody makes eye contact with Zan, gives a quick wave, like, kind of a \"Hi! Morning!\" but without saying anything.\nOliver: Yeah.\nAlan: And then kind of puts a finger to his lips, kind of like a “ssh!” and then points to the other people in the room still sleeping and he then points at Zan, points at himself, and points to the door, and makes a shrug gesture in the universal, \"You, me, outside, question mark?\"\nTalia: Zan grimaces and sort of, like stretches a little bit in place and then nods and kicks her blankets out of the way of the door so they both can leave.\nOliver: Okay, both of you make a stealth check.\n[Rolls]\nAlan: [Sad noises] Oh no. Sorry, Erica.\nTalia: Uh, that's a 15.\nAlan: That's a 2 + 2 = 4.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Cody, you kind of try to gather up your colored pencils in your backpack and you go to jump off the couch, and then you just trip over the arm of the couch. Zan, make a dexterity saving throw.\nTalia: Uh, that's a 10 - 1 = 9.\nOliver: Okay, Cody just barrels right into you and the two of you land in a heap on the ground next to the door. No one else in the room wakes up, though.\nZAN: Oh, ow.\nCODY: [Whispered] Sorry!\nZAN: Okay. All right, let's go.\nAlan: Cody starts tiptoeing an almost cartoonish fashion to the door.\nOliver: It's very loud and creaky. Zan, you wince every time he makes a step. But you make it to the door and you pull it open and step outside of this little stone house, into the clearing in the woods. Outside the air is fresh and easy to breathe. On the other side of the clearing is that glass geodesic dome surrounded by a garden. The moss covering the rest of the clearing glitters in the sun, wet from a night of rain. You take a deep breath out here and feel instantly at ease.\nCODY: [Deep breath] Oh, it's nice out here.\nZAN: So, so, much nicer out here. It was really stuffy in there.\nCODY: Yeah.\nOliver: The two of you are standing outside and you notice quickly that it's no longer overcast. And for the first time in your short journey, you can see the sky... and it's fucking wild. To the north and south, the sky is a soft shade of blue rippled with bands of pink and yellow that remind you of photos of the Northern Lights. Across the center of the sky, cutting it in half, is a jagged smear of deep purple. It runs across the entire patch of sky you can see from this little clearing. To the east, you see the light of two yellow suns, almost overlapping, peeking through the trees.\nZAN: Whuh...\nOliver: You also see Max outside, jogging along the tree line.\nCODY: Uh, what?\nZAN: Well, okay. There goes my future post-apocalyptic earth theory.\nCODY: First thing you learn in school, when you're learning your colors, is the sky is blue.\nZAN: I mean--\nCODY: Either someone lied or something's really up here.\nZAN: Okay, but the sky's not always blue. There's like, so many colors of the sky, even on Earth.\nCODY: But the sky is blue. Grass is green. Sun is yellow. These are basic facts.\nZAN: Suns is yellow.\nCODY: Yeah, there's two of them. That's weird. Um...\nZAN: This is a lot. That's weird.\nAlan: Cody tries to wave and get Max attention. If he's paying attention.\nRobot: Nope. He’s in the zone.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Okay, he's in the zone. He just keeps jogging.\nAlan: Cody tries to wave even harder. As if he could wave louder and be more effective. But when it doesn't work, he finally just holds his wrist because he kind of stressed it a little bit waving.\nZAN: You hurt your wrist waving?\nCODY: I tried to get his attention, [sighs]\nAlan: And as he's looking at his wrists, he sees his SPEL.\nCODY: Hey, Zan? You were practicing fighting yesterday, right?\nZAN: Yeah. It was pretty cool, huh?\nCODY: Um, maybe I should practice doing the spells and stuff so that I can, you know, get to the menu faster. And like, so I can be better at fighting and not almost get hurt like I did last time.\nZAN: Okay.\nCODY: Can you help me?\nZAN: Sure. Did you have, like, a plan for this?\nAlan: Cody just stands there, as if having a plan never even crossed his mind. And he feels like he's in trouble for not having one.\nZAN: Uhhhhh.\nCODY: Um.\nZAN: No… I just, well--\nCODY: What if we can just, like, help me find a target. And we can just like, I don't know, make up, different ideas of what happens in battle and like to see if I can, like... duck and dodge? I don't know, I don't want to shoot you. That's not my plan. That was not--my plan was not a duel.\nZAN: What about Max?\nCODY: Well, I kind of want to ask him before I shot spells at him and he didn't pay attention when I waved him real hard.\nZAN: Uh, fine. Well, what spells you got?\nCODY: Well, I got Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are the ones that I can use a lot of.\nZAN: Okay, so let's stick with those, just in case.\nCODY: Okay.\nZAN: Well, Light, you seem to be pretty proficient at already. So...\nCODY: Oh, I got that one down!\nAlan: And then he immediately makes his hoodie glow for no reason whatsoever.\nZAN: Rad. How about...\nTalia: Can I look around to see if there's anything, you know, that we could practice on? That maybe we could set up somewhere else, or I could hold out or something?\nOliver: Let's see. Yeah, you take a look around the clearing. That practice dummy that\nyou were fighting yesterday has collapsed back into a pile of logs and you don't know what spell or thing that Windred did to make it stand up.\nTalia: Mmhmm.\nOliver: The pile of rocks from the golem is gone. So that's weird.\nTalia: [Slightly more concerned] Mmhmm.\nOliver: And the clearing is surrounded by a bunch of trees. So you could probably pick a tree and shoot at that tree.\nZAN: All right, let's start with these trees, over here at the edge of clearing.\nTalia: And I lead Cody over to about-- God, I don't know how far you can shoot spells. Like 20 feet away from the tree line?\nAlan: That'll work.\nZAN: Let's start by trying to get it between two trees. And then if you're good enough then we could see if you could try to hit a tree.\nCODY: Okay!\nZAN: So, I say Ray of Frost, because you can't really shoot Mage Hand at things.\nCODY: Okay!\nAlan: Okay, he'll get his card out of his pocket, you know, in his chosen fighting stance, and he'll quickly like, as fast as he can, hit his wrist together, get the menu, and hit Ray of Frost and try to get it between two trees.\nOliver: Go ahead and roll an attack.\nAlan: That is a 6 + 4 = 10.\nOliver: Yeah, there's a decently big gap between trees that Zan pointed out to you and you shoot a beam of silvery energy through it that smacks something in the forest. Kind of see some birds go \"squak squak squak\" and fly away.\nCODY: [Giggles] Nice!\nZAN: They're fine.\nCODY: OK, um...\nZAN: Why do you need those cards? Doesn't get in the way of you like, opening up the menu and tapping?\nAlan: Cody looks down at his cards and then looks up at Zan. He squints, trying to decide how much to tell her. He's like,\nCODY: Well, um, they're my friends? I mean, I had them for a long time. Here, let me just show you.\nAlan: And he holds out all of the cards in a fan. When Zan looks at the fan of cards, she'll see that they all have a picture of a creature looking thing on the top half. Um, and then on the bottom, right hand corner is their number. You see various numbers, a 1, a 9. And he shows the card he was just using and on top, you see this four-legged, ice-covered creature that is shooting a snowball out its mouth. Cody goes,\nCODY: Well, this is... this is Chillama.\n[Laughter]\nCODY: And I drew her a while ago. And then when I discovered I could shoot an ice beam, I just... I thought of her, and I thought it would be cool to think that Chillama was there with me helping me, you know, fight? And, I don't know, like-- when things get intense and we're fighting... who wouldn't wanna have an animal friend with you to kind of keep yourself company? Oh, and here's the newest one I made!\nAlan: On the bottom, you see, it's number 15 and of all the cards, it looks brand spanking new. The other ones with the lower numbers have wrinkles, they've been handled. This one looks like it was drawn days ago. And on the top half, you see a little white hand with a face and red accents.\nCODY: Well, when I got Mage Hand, I realized I didn't have a creature that went with Mage Hand. So I drew one! And I named him Helppo. See? Look!\nZAN: Does he, uh, make hamburgers?\nAlan: Cody kind of looks down, ashamed that she figured out his inspiration.\n[Laughter]\nTalia: Zan pats Cody on the head.\nZAN: Nah. Those are pretty cool.\nOliver: You look up and Max is standing right behind you, also looking at your cool cards.\nCODY: Oh, hey Max! Zan asked about my cards, and I was showing them to her. See, here's Chillama, and here's Helppo. Oh, and oh, here's my first card I ever drew. It's a skunk!\nAlan: And sure enough, you look at the card top half There's a vaguely skunk-shaped creature, but instead of normal black and white, it's oranges and reds and yellows.\nCODY: Yeah, it's a skunk, but, uh, he shoots fire out his butt. [giggle]\n[Laughter]\nCODY: Because he's a fire skunk. But, well-- he was named Sparky when I first came up with him, because you know, fire. [Giggles.] But Jex told me I should be a little bit more creative with my names, if I could. And, like, you know, mix the animal name and like the element together?\nZAN: Mmhmm.\nCODY: So I was like, \"I know!\" and so here--this is Spunk! It's for sparky and skunk, put together!\n[Laughter]\nMAX: [Uncomfortably.] Mmhmm!\nCODY: Ain't he cool?\nMAX: That's… great, bud.\n[Muffled laughter]\nCODY: Yeah, he's really cool.\nMAX: Great.\nTalia: Zan's just nodding vigorously. Like she started out, just sort of like nodding slowly. And she's just like,\nZAN: Mmhmm! Mmhmm!\nAlan: Cody looks up and sees them both smiling and nodding vigorously and is like,\nCODY: Okay, I'll show you another one! Uh, here's Flowl! My psychic owl!\n[Laughter]\nAlan: You see an owl with spiral-y eyes.\nZAN: I like Flowl.\nCODY: With the big eyes, I thought that they could glow, and that could be where light came from! My spell, Light. So yeah, just whenever I'm using my spells, I just pretend I have my Codymon with me. I know it's silly.\nAlan: Cody looks down at his cards.\nCODY: But it helps me focus, when I get scared or things get bad.\nZAN: Silly can be pretty cool sometimes. I don't... don't know a lot about silly, but I, uh... think it-- that this is cool for you. So, uh, yeah. Forget what I said about taking the time to take them out. That's uh, I don't know. Maybe we can figure out a way that you can get them out faster or something. Quickest draw in the... wherever we are.\nCODY: That sounds like fun.\nZAN: Yeah. Alright. Well, why don't you put them away and we can try taking them out a couple times to see how fast you are?\nCODY: Okay!\nAlan: He puts them in his pocket.\nCODY: You gonna, like, countdown?\nZAN: No, I'm not gonna tell you when it's gonna happen.\nCODY: Okay?\nZAN: It'll be a surprise.\n{12:57}\nCODY: He gets in his ready stance. Kind of like a Western. Like, hand over his pocket, just kind of waiting.\nZAN: Draw!\nOliver: Okay, make a sleight of hand check.\nAlan: [Rolls.] [Scoffs.] 3 + 1 = 4.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Cody plunges his hand in his pocket, rips out all of the cards, and they just go fucking flying. There's cards everywhere.\nZAN: Oof--\nCODY: Oh no, no, no, no, no--\nZAN: Okay, well--\nTalia: I'll help him pick them up.\nOliver: I'll say the three of you help gather up the cards. Zan, you catch a glimpse of something moving in the bushes. Could you make a perception check for me?\nTalia: Ah, that's a 16.\nOliver: You could have sworn there was someone there, watching you. Just for a moment.\nZAN: Hey, you guys finish gathering these up. I'll be right back, okay? I just need to check that.... bush.\nOliver: Zan, you make your way into the bushes. You try to put together what you saw. Your best guess is that it was a person standing there, with long curly hair, and you go and you find the spot where they were standing. But then the trail immediately vanishes.\nTalia: There's no trail at all? I can't like...\nOliver: No, no trail.\nZAN: Huh. That's really disconcerting, because I'm really good at trails.\nOliver: Zan says to the wilderness.\n[Laughter]\nTalia: All right, I'm just gonna put my hands in my pockets and sort of casually turn around and walk back towards them, but, like, keep an eye on that spot. Just, from time to time look back over there.\nOliver: Okay. Why don't you make another perception check for me?\nTalia: That's a five.\nOliver: Yeahhh, You keep glancing over as you and Max and Cody practice him getting his cards out of his pocket and then shooting some trees with Ray of Frost. But you don't see anything again.\nTalia: Gonna get a better D20 now.\nOliver: Throw that one in the garbage. So the three of you practice this for a bit. It's a nice day out. The suns are casting light onto your little clearing. It's still weird.\nZAN: Yeah. Just got to be ready, Cody. All right? So, any time I might do it. At any time in the next couple of days, just be, like, \"Draw!\" You're gonna have to try and take them out as fast as possible.\nCODY: Okay!\nZAN: I'm gonna be watching. We're gonna wait and see how this goes. Okay?\nCODY: All right.\nOliver: From somewhere high above you, you all hear a noise. [Whoomph Whoomph].\nZAN: Uhhh?\nOliver: And you look up, and you see an enormous creature with giant, leathery wings descending on the clearing.\nZAN: Uh--uh oh--\nCODY: Uhhhhhhh-\nMAX: Uhhh-\nTalia: All right, I'm gonna grab Cody and run towards the house.\nCODY: Is that a pterodactyl?!\nZAN: I don't know! It doesn't really matter what it is right now!\nOliver: What's Max doing?\nRobot: Yep, Max is gonna just run behind them, but keeping an eye on it.\nOliver: Yeah, As you run up to the little house, the wind kicked up from this creature's wings sending dust and leaves in swirls all around you, making you shield your eyes. But you do make it to the door. You go inside.\nZAN: Guys, there's a thing. The--there's a thing!\nCODY: There's a pterodactyl!\nTalia: I'm like pushing Cody ahead of me.\nZAN: Come on-- it's a thing!\nOliver: You tumble into the living room, shutting the door behind you, and you find Jasmin and Erica still asleep on the floor and they wake up to the sound of you guys shouting at them.\nZAN: Guys, get up! Get up! There's a thing! There's a big-- a big wing thing with wings!\nERICA: [Groggy] What?\nJASMIN: What? What's going on?\nCODY: It's a pterodactyl!\nERICA: It's a… ptero...?\nAllison: Erica scratches her head.\nZAN: It's a big-- a big thing-- I didn't get a good look at it cause it was really big. And there was, like, light behind it and was a big thing-- and, uhhhhh, hide?\nERICA: Hide? Uh, okay.\nJASMIN: Where?\nZAN: I don't know!\nERICA: Should we get Lili and Nula?\nJASMIN: Uh--\nZAN: Yes.\nCODY: Are they-- Are they outside? Are they here?\nOliver: I mean, they're not in this room with you, Cody,\nCODY: Uh...\nOliver: You look around this room, Cody. They're not there.\n[Laughter]\nTalia: Zan opens the door just like a crack to look back outside and see what it is.\nOliver: There's also a window you could look out.\nTalia: Oh, Zan looks out the window.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Okay, great. You see an enormous creature landing in the clearing. Before you is a dragon.\nZAN: [whispers] Hooooly shit.\nOliver: It's at least like 30 feet long and covered in pale pink scales that glitter in the sunlight. And you can now see that someone is riding it, from a saddle mounted just behind its enormous head. The dragon's head is about the size of a small car and has four glinting green eyes. Yeah, as you watch it, the rider dismounts and you watch them pull a large bundle off the dragon's back and remove the saddle and then start walking towards the house.\nAlice: Can I flee into a hallway?\nOliver: Yes. Go for it. Make a stealth check.\n[dice rolls]\nAlice: 16 - 1 = 15.\nOliver: Yeah. Jasmin just bolts out of the room and is gone.\nAlan: Cody's gonna dive under the couch.\nOliver: Make a stealth check.\nAlan: That is a 19 + 2 = 21.\nOliver: Holy shit. Okay, Cody flattens himself and just is gone.\n[Laughter]\nTalia: Cody disappears!\nOliver: Like, you had Jasmin and Cody there, and you look around and they're not there anymore.\nTalia: Can I see who the person walking towards the house is?\nOliver: Yeah. The person's getting closer. They're tall and sturdily built. They have a pair of antlers sticking out of their curly hair. They look like they're wearing gray leather armor, goggles, and a cloth pulled up over their mouth and nose.\nTalia: Yeah, I-- I think-- this is so much, Zan's just gonna, like, sit there for a second, just like watching. Like, that was a fucking dragon, what?\nOliver: Yeah.\nRobot: Did we see where the other three went to bed last night? Did they go upstairs?\nOliver: Yeah! There's a narrow little staircase and they went up there.\nRobot: Okay, Max is gonna run over to the stairs, and just yell up the stairs.\nMAX: Hey, uh... were you expecting a guest?\nOliver: Okay. Yeah. You hear some, like thumping and rustling and someone going like,\nWINDRED: What was that?\nOliver: And then Lili comes trotting down the stairs and she's wearing that big puffy bathrobe that Erica was wearing yesterday. And she's like,\nLILI: What? What-- dear? Sorry. It's very early.\nZAN: Yeah-- uh-- There was a dragon?\nLILI: [Gasps]\nZAN: And now there's a person\nLILI: Oh!\nZAN: From-- from the dragon?\nLILI: Oh, my gods! Oh, my gosh, oh!\nOliver: And then you hear a loud knocking door, just like a THUMP THUMP THUMP. And Lili runs over and throws the door open and is like,\nLILI: Remy!\nOliver: And then she runs out the door and gathers this big man up in a big, big hug. And the two of them are excitedly greeting each other on the front step.\nZAN: Okay. I think you can come out, Cody. I don't know where Jasmin went.\nCODY: Are you sure?\nZAN: Shit! Where--\n[Laughter]\nOliver: The couch is talking. You don't understand how.\nZAN: I didn't see you down there.\nAlice: I think Jasmin very cautiously pokes her head around a corner of the door.\nZAN: I think that Lili seems to know him?\nAlan: Cody's brave enough to have just his head sticking out the bottom of the couch.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: There's a couch with a head on it. It's terrifying. Yeah, through the open door, you see Lili and the man she called Remy walking back towards the dragon. They're excitedly talking to each other. Lili turned back to the house and she says,\nLILI: Oh, um, come on! Come on. Come meet Remy.\nRobot: Max is out the door.\nZAN: Okay. Uh...\nJASMIN: Won't we get eaten?\nOliver: Lili can't hear your question from there, Jasmin. Max, you go outside, and you see Remy rifling through this, like, big bundle that he pulled off of the dragon's back. And Lili is just, like, chattering at him, excitedly. Telling him about a bunch of plants and stuff like that.\nTalia: Yeah, I go out there.\nAllison: Yeah, I'm going out as well.\nOliver: You guys wander outside and you see Remy pull this like, long stick with a bunch of bristles on it out of his supplies. And as he's talking to Lili, he starts just scrubbing the dragon like it's a big toothbrush. And the dragon starts lifting its back leg and kind of like thumping it a little bit as he gets the spot, like right on its neck.\nAlice: Does every thump, like, shake the ground a bit?\nOliver: Oh, definitely.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: It's a lot. But this dragon looks very content. And Remy's talking to Lili, and he's like,\nREMY: Yeah, sorry... Um, sorry I'm here so early. I know we said next week, but I just-- I got this great deal taking some shipping, uh, out West and I-- Oh, there's people... here? Hey. What?\nZAN: Uh, hey.\nLILI: Oh, right! Yes. Oh, Um uh, yes. Uh, these are our guests who we met yesterday. They emerged from the forest, and they've been sleeping in her house. This is Erica, she/her, and Jasmin, she/her...\nOliver: And she  goes through the list of you, and she's like,\nLILI: And this is Remy, he/him, this is our Nephew. He brings us supplies from time to time-- I just wasn't expecting him so early!\nZAN: Hey. Hey, Remy. So, uh, nice to meet you.\nJASMIN: Hi.\nZAN: Sorry we yelled when your dragon appeared. I'm guessing you didn't actually hear that, but we--we weren’t, it was a cool yell of surprise.\n{22:24}\nOliver: Okay, I'm not gonna make you roll the deception check for that. That was dumb. Remy stopped scrubbing the dragon and is kind of like,\nREMY: Oh, uh, hi? Wait, where did you come from?\nOliver: And Lili's like, \nLILI: Oh, they all have amnesia. It's so weird. But they don't know. Isn’t that funny? They're heading south.\nAlan: By this point, Cody has worked his way out of the couch. He had been watching from the door, kind of peeking his head out, watching the scene.\nCODY: Is… is it okay to come out now?\nZAN: Yeah, we seem good.\nAlan: Okay, so he kind of looks around. He’s like,\nCODY: Is that a pterodactyl? \nJASMIN: No. \nCODY: What is it?\nREMY: Oh, uh, this is Beck. She's about 2. We run shipping together.\nCODY: [hesitantly] Hi, Beck.\nOliver: The dragon swivels its massive head around and looks at you and Cody. You get a look at these four green eyes. It tilts its head to the side and then scoots its head all the way up into you and just nudges you right on the stomach.\nCODY: Aah! Oh, hey!\nOliver: It's kind of like getting hit slowly by a car. \n[Laughter]\nOliver: Um, make a strength saving throw. \nTalia: Haha, yes! A strength saving throw! For Cody!\nAlan: That thing Cody is great at!\nAllison: Poor baby boy.\nRobot: A small child.\n[dice rolls]\nAlan: That’s a 12 - 2, a 10.\nOliver: Okay, nice. You just kind of stumble backwards. And Remy’s like,\nREMY: Hey hey, Beck. Come on, come on. He doesn't have any treats.\nOliver: And kind of like puts up a hand and pushes her face out of the way, which clearly doesn't actually push her out of the way. But she does move her head when he pushes on her.\nJASMIN: You can stay behind me, Cody.\n{24:00}\nAlan: Cody’s actually on the ground, he’s actually smiling a lot.\nCODY: [giggles] She's fun!\nOliver: And Remy smiles at you and is like,\nREMY: Yeah, yeah, she is. This is weird for me, but ah, I mean, since you're here, you want to help me bring these supplies inside?\nOliver: And he gestures to this, like, bundle that he took off the dragon's back and pulls down the outer layer, and it's like a big tarp wrapped around a bunch of boxes and crates. There's, like, some big bags of flour and rice and stuff like that.\nZAN: Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sorry. I'm sorry. \nOliver: You just, like, pick something up and start walking towards the house.\nTalia: Yeah, I go to pick something up.\nOliver: Great. Yeah. Grab like a big bag of rice and follow him towards the house.\nAllison: Yeah. Erica starts carrying things as well.\nTalia: On the way back to the house could I do a quick check back where I saw the person possibly? \nOliver: Yes. Make a perception check. \nTalia: Uh, that's a 15. \nOliver: Nope, you still can't spot anything, \nTalia: Hm, okay.\nOliver: There's a weird-looking couple of creatures over there that you hadn't noticed before. They're kind of like crows, but then they're jumping and cawing and as one turns around you see, it's got furry back legs and a long tail that’s striped. You’re like “that’s weird.”\nTalia: Huh, okay. I keep going into the house. Check those out later.\nAlan: Cody is enamored with the dragon and kind of misses the whole point when people start moving things. He finally sees people helping and he looks back and forth between the stuff and the dragon and hits his wrists together and uses Mage Hand to have the Mage Hand start moving things back and forth while he stays and looks at the dragon.\nOliver: Okay. Um, what's the range on Mage Hand?\nAlan: It's a 30 foot range. Is that enough to get to the house?\nOliver: Um, no, and they can only lift 10 pounds, so...\nAlan: Whatever. Whatever is under 10 pounds.\nOliver: It picks up an apple or something and takes it 30 feet and then puts it down, and then it starts just making a pile of apples that’s 30 feet closer to the house.\n[Laughter]\nAlan: [crosstalk] That works, it’s helping.\nOliver: He’s definitely Helppo-ing.\nRobot: Up to this point, Max has been hanging a little bit back from the group and just staring at this dragon and then furiously scribbling in his notebook. And when he sees people start moving around he snaps out of it and goes to help them move things.\nOliver: Okay, great.\nAlice: Jasmin helps too.\nOliver: Okay, awesome. Yeah, Remy directs you when you go out of the living room. There’s a kitchen area with a big table. He’s like,\nREMY: Just set most of it here. Under the table, uh, I guess.\nOliver: And goes back out to the dragon. Lili has also picked up, like, four crates and is easily walking them towards the house. Yeah. So most of you spend a little time doing that. When he gets back over to the dragon Remy looks at you, Cody, and looks up at the dragon and is like,\nREMY: Do you spend much time with dragons?\n[Laughter]\nCody: D-d-d-dragon… did you just say dragon? Is this an actual dragon?\nREMY: Uh, yeah? Not an illusion or anything, uh-\nCODY: Where I’m from, dragons are only, um,  told in stories. I’ve never seen one.\nREMY: Oh, probably… you came from north of here?\nCODY: Uhhhhhhhh… [hesitantly] sure.\nTalia: Did we come from north of here?\nOliver: You did, you were following a trail south.\nRobot: Technically, yeah.\nREMY: They don’t use dragons up north, they don’t do so well in the cold.\nCODY: Oh. Does she eat berries?\nREMY: Uh, I guess. She’d probably eat the whole bush. Uh, she found one.\nAlan: Cody wants to rummage in his backpack for the spare berry that he stored back the first time Jasmin cast Goodberry.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Cody, you rummage through your bag and surprising me, I guess, you don’t find a giant smear of berry. Surprising your all-knowing God, there’s no big berry mess. You don’t find the berry in there.\nCODY: Thought I had a berry, sorry. I’ll find you one another time.\nREMY: That’s fine, she’ll grab a snack when she’s tired of watching y’all.\nOliver: You notice the dragon sitting there looking at all of you, swinging its two big tails back and forth slowly. Remy looks up at her and slaps her on the leg and says,\nREMY: Go on, go play, we got stuff to do.\nOliver: And the dragon bounds off. The ground shakes under you with each big leap that she takes. She heads over to the stream and settles down and starts drinking out of it.\nTalia: Zan watches the dragon, kinda sadly. But doesn’t say anything, just “hm.”\nRobot: Yeah, Max is doing the same.\nOliver: Yeah, I imagine most of you have stopped mid-way between the pile of stuff and the house and are just watching her. She drinks for a bit and looks around and looks at Remy, who has taken another armful of stuff into the house. Once he’s in the house, she just rolls right over into the stream and starts sloshing around on the back, getting mud everywhere. She’s all dirty now.\n[Laughter]\nAllison: Oliver, I’m sorry but this is a dragon-watching podcast now.\nOliver: Great.\nRobot: The next ten episodes are just us following the dragon around.\nTalia: Zan’s completely stopped moving.\nOliver: Great.\n==== MIDROLL START ==== \n{29:40}\nAlan: Well hello, welcome to Dice Disasters, which is now apparently about watching dragons. Robot, are you excited about shifting our podcast focus at this point?\nRobot: Yeah, I feel like we've had quite a few paradigm shifts in the last couple episodes. First we were a rat in the woods, now we’re a dragon podcast. So uh, really changing things around, keeping it fresh.\nAlan:Yeah, we don’t want people to get too bored with our story so far. So yeah, I’m really glad Oliver sensed it was time to become a nature podcast, but focused solely on dragon care, dragon behavior. Maybe we can get some David Attenborough voiceover to go along with our… that’s a terrible joke, nobody’s going to get that joke. I barely get that joke.\n[Laughter]\nRobot: I understood it, but I’ve never watched a David Attenborough documentary.\nAlan: Oh, I know, I just know he’s a big nature documentary dude. Now I’m tempted to leave this part in the midroll. But anyways… thank you for listening to our podcast. We’re so happy that y’all have come with us this far. We’ve had a lot of really awesome people reach out to us this week, especially since we’ve changed our schedule. People are happy that we’ve gone weekly for the little bit. Robot, have you seen anything online that has excited you?\nRobot: Oh, there was some fanart on Twitter of Zan in the “thinking math lady” meme. I don’t know the exact name of it, but I thought it was just hilarious.\nAlan: Oh yeah! That was amazing. Some of the fans are knocking it out of the park, and we love seeing that stuff, because you showing how much you’re enjoying the podcast not only makes us feel great and that people are enjoying what we’re making, but it also helps other people not listening to us know how much fun you’re having listening. And we want this group of people to grow. Go on social media, share your art and your love the show on Twitter using the hashtag #dicedisasters or tag us on Instagram. Just let people know how much you’re loving it.\nRobot: And if you do do those things, you could get your name in the show as an NPC.\nAlan: Yeah, we’re compiling a list every week of names of people who have shared the show for Oliver to look at and use when coming up with names for new NPCs. So yeah, get your name on that list by sharing the show.\nRobot: And if you have any ideas for an item that you want to see at some point in the show, you can go submit it on our website.\nAlan: Ooh, yeah!\nRobot: And maybe that will show up at some point.\nAlan: Yeah, that’ll be fun. From the cast and especially Oliver, who told me specifically to tell everybody that your kind words and your enthusiasm means so much to us. We’re doing this for the fun of it, we love hanging out with our friends and playing this game. And we love making this for people, so hearing that it’s brightening up your day is brightening up our days.\nRobot: Yeah, we’re all constantly yelling amongst ourselves about all of your kind words and fanart and things.\nAlan: Yes, definitely know that we see it and we yell constantly about it. It’s so great. But hey, we wish you all the absolute best. We hope you’re staying safe and staying healthy, and we’re so happy to be able to do what we can to put a smile on your face this week. And with that in mind, let’s get back to the story.\nRobot: See ya around!\nAlan: Bye!\n==== MIDROLL END ==== \n{33:25}\nTalia: God, I really want to play with the dragon.\nAlice: I think as everyone is watching this, Jasmin will probably say to whoever happens to be nearby,\nJASMIN: Yeah, I guess it would be pretty dangerous if I turned to that.\nOliver: Yeah, who are you next to?\nAlice: Good question. I don’t know!\nRobot: Roll a d4 or something.\n[Laughter]\nAlice: Rolling a d4.\n[dice rolls]\nAlice: It’s a 4.\nTalia: Did you decide who was each number?\nAlice: Yes, it’s a 4 which is Zan.\nTalia: Oh okay, cool. Hey.\nZAN: Yeah, that’s probably not a great idea for keeping it on the DL. But it’d be pretty cool huh?\nJASMIN: It would be, but I don’t think I’d like being that big.\nOliver: Actually, as you’re talking about that Teacup, the little cat/goblin with clover on his back, steps on your foot and looks up at you and goes “mreoooow.” And starts bumping his head against your knee, Jasmin.\nAlice: Is there anyone watching me?\nOliver: I mean… you’re kind of out in the open where you’re standing right now. So no one’s watching you.\nAlice: I think Jasmin looks to the left and looks to the right and picks up Teacup and tries to run around the corner of the house out of sight.\n[Laughter]\nAlan: Stealing this cat!\nOliver: Make a stealth check.\nTalia: Yeah, let’s steal that cat!\n[dice rolls]\nAlice: 19 - 1, 18!\nOliver: Yeah, okay. Zan, Jasmin was standing next to you saying something about a dragon and you were kind of looking at the dragon and nodding, and you turn to look at her and she’s not there.\nZAN: Why the fuck does Jasmin keep vanishing? I don’t think she has invisibility, I looked at her spell list!\n{35:06}\nOliver: You look down instinctively, there’s no rat on the ground. But yeah, Jasmin, you’re tucked around the other side of the house. You don’t think anyone saw you.\nAlice: I’m gonna pet Teacup and then I’m gonna very cautiously scan him.\nOliver: Great, yeah, out of your wristband comes a little flared beam of flight that goes “psshhh” and scans him up and down. When it’s complete, the scan button grays out and you now have a little 3D rendering of Teacup the cat in your Wild Shape list.\nAlice: I think Jasmin hugs Teacup and puts him down and then very excitedly claps her hands and goes,\nJASMIN: [excitedly] Yes yes yes yes yes!\nZAN: Jasmin, did you get eaten by a rock monster?\nJASMIN: No, I’m good. Actually, I want to show you something, can you come here?\nZAN: That sounds suspicious, but sure.\nOliver: Okay, Zan. You come around the side of the house and Jasmin is standing there.\nJASMIN: Look look look look, Zan!\nTALIA: I look.\nAlice: Jasmin is pointing at Teacup, who I imagine is just kind of chilling.\nOliver: Yeah, he laid down in the sun and is licking his butt or something.\nAlice: And then she opens up her menu and pushes Wild Shape.\nOliver: Okay, um… Zan, since you’re staring right at her, you watch as in a split second Jasmin’s eyes grow really big and her pupils turn to slit and her nose juts forward out of her face. And then she shrinks and fur erupts from her and there are now 2 Teacups on the ground. One of whom is looking at you with its mouth wide open, like “hey!”\n[Laughter]\nZAN: [hesitantly] Oookay… should you really be doing that right now?\nAlice: Teacup Jasmin cocks her head and looks really sad.\nZAN: Oh, okay--like, it’s cool, don’t get me wrong, this is really really cool, but…\nOliver: Jasmin, make a wisdom saving throw.\nAlice: Alright.\n[dice rolls]\nAlice: Uh, 4 + 3.\nOliver: You would really really like to go chase that shiny bug that just started into your vision. It’s very shiny. Look at it go.\nAlice: I think you can see Jasmin’s pupils dilate and then she does the cat butt wiggle and she just hops away and runs after a bug.\nZAN: Oh, okay, oh no…\nTalia: I’m gonna run after Jasmin. I guess I put the stuff down and just run.\nOliver: You put a bushel full of weird-looking cucumbers down on the ground next to Teacup, who is still licking his butt, and run off after Jasmin.\nZAN: Max, I left some stuff over by Teacup! Be right back!\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Okay, great. You can follow her, she’s jumping though some patches of long grass and then through the garden.\nTalia: I’m not going to stop her, but I am going to make sure that I am always just sort of following.\nOliver: The rest of you, you finish bringing the rest of the supplies inside and then I imagine you all kind of congregate back out in the clearing, watching this dragon. Out of the corner of your eye, you see Zan running through the garden, and you’re like “Oh, Zan! Anyway, that’s a fucking dragon.”\nTalia: That’s a dragon, and Zan is being completely normal.\nOliver: Yep! Remy comes back out of the house and sees that Beck has rolled in the stream, and is just like,\nREMY: [exasperated] Come on, I just washed you! Ugh!\nOliver: And he rubs his hands down his face.\nREMY: [sighs] Okay.\nOliver: And stomps over to where Beck is laying in the stream.\nREMY: Get up, come on, get over here!\nOliver: And she’s now like, playfully jumping away from home and like, wagging her tails around, enjoying him chasing her.\nREMY: Just get out of the mud! I don’t care, just get out of the mud!\nOliver: And he’s like, shooing her, and so she trots over to the edge of the clearing and you hear a massive crack noise, and see that Beck has pulled down a tree at the edge of the clearing. And Remy sighs and puts his hands on his hips, turns and walks over to where Lili is standing, and they start talking. You watch the dragon just methodically pull all the leaves off of the tree, and then she lays down and props the trunk up between her front feet and goes to fucking town chewing up the wood of the branches.\n[Laughter]\nAlan: Cody has sat down crisscross at a distance that he feels is safe from the dragon, but he’s just there to watch this dragon do anything it does, just kind of in awe.\nOliver: Great! There’s kind of chunks of wood splintering off and flying away from the dragon where it’s eating this tree. Eventually Windred has come outside and is also talking to Remy and Lili. After a couple minutes, you see Remy look at all of you and then look back at Lili and be like,\nREMY: Okay, uh, guess I’m heading out now. I won’t be able to get you your next run until two weeks after our normal date, but should be able to do that just fine.\nOliver: He looks at Erica, Max, and Cody, who are standing/sitting, watching the dragon and waves to them.\nREMY: I thought there were more of you, but all right, I guess I’ll… goodbye, then?\nAlan: Upon hearing that dragon leaving soon might be happening, Cody is like,\nCODY: Hey, wait, you’re going somewhere? You just got here. Dragon just got here!\nOliver: I didn’t get a turn on the dragon yet, guys! Remy is like,\nREMY: Oh, um, we just run supply shipments, like a job out west. We’re heading out to Fell’s Keep, gonna pick up a shipment from there. Take it out to my next job. Do you all live here now…?\nAlan: Cody looks at Erica and is like,\nCODY: Uh… you have the map. Where are we going next?\nERICA: Actually, I was going to talk to everybody about that, but it seems like the most logical is Fell’s Keep. Um, how long does it take you to get to Fell’s Keep?\nREMY: On Beck? Without a load, probably about an hour or so? If she’s fully loaded up, maybe two. It took us two to get here.\nCODY: How long does it take to walk there?\nREMY: I-I don’t know, I have a dragon. I ride the dragon.\n[Laughter]\nREMY: It’s uh, much faster than walking.\nRobot: Peasants, without your dragon.\nOliver: Lili has come over and she’s like,\nLILI: Oh, it takes like a week or so to walk there! I’ve done it a couple times. There’s some nice spots to camp along the river, and, uh, it’s not too bad. Is that where you’re going, down to Fell’s Keep?\nERICA: Yeah, I couldn’t think of anywhere else that we should go, but…\nAllison: Erica kind of looks to Max and is like “that makes sense, right?” We should probably go figure out where we are, what we’re doing? Where to go next?\n{42:26}\nMAX: Uh, weren’t we doing something on the way here?\n[Laughter]\nOliver: That’s all he remembers.\nRobot: Yeah.\nErica: Oh yeah, the fabric. I wasn’t paying attention where it went after this. Where is Zan? And where is Jasmin, for that matter?\nOliver: You turn and look around the clearing and you see Zan doing this weird hop-jump-skip movement through the garden. She looks super awkward.\nERICA: Zan! Zan!\nZAN: Hm?\nErica: Get over here!\nZAN: Oh, uh, I, uh… um, it’s… do I have to?\nErica: I mean… what are you doing, just chasing the cat?\nZAN: Yes.\n[Laughter]\nZAN: Yes, it got a thing and I had to—I need to make sure it doesn’t swallow it.\nERICA: Oh my gosh, does the cat have Hat?\nAllison: And Erica runs over.\nZan: No—\n[Laughter]\nTalia: When Erica gets closer, I’m like,\nZAN: [quietly] No, the cat’s Jasmin right now. I’m just making sure she doesn’t run away like when she was a rat.\nErica: Oh, um, shit. Um… how long did it take for Jasmin to change back? I don’t remember.\nAllison: Erica is looking so anxious right now.\nAlice: Jasmin is rolling around in some dirt.\nOliver: Yeah, you’ve caught up to her, you don’t have to run anymore. Teacup’s kind of like a light-colored cat, and this one’s now dusty and kind of dirty, very content.\nZan: Um, I don’t remember because I was distracted, it was the berries, and so she pressed it and they went over the berries. God, I don’t remember how long it took. I’m not good with like, time amounts when I’m not tracking people.\nErica: Yeah, that makes sense. I am very concerned that Remy over there, who already thinks that maybe we’re a little bit weird, a little bit strange—I am very worried about him seeing Jasmin turn back into Jasmin, so I don’t know what we should do.\nAllison: And Erica is like, visibly sweating.\nZAN: I’m gonna just—here, I’ll grab cat Jasmin and just like, run her over back sort of around the house to the other side from where we are right now.\nAlan: Cody, completely oblivious to everything that’s happening, is just going to start asking tons of questions about dragons ‘cause he didn’t realize he had a timer until the dragon was leaving. And so now he wants to know everything about this dragon.\nOliver: Okay, great. I’ll say that Cody has Remy and by extension, Lili, completely distracted talking about dragon stuff.\nRobot: Yeah, Max is also there just listening.\nOliver: Great.\nAlan: In the middle of asking all these questions, Cody finally has the courage to ask the question,\nCODY: Um… so… if you wanted to, how many people could you take on your dragon?\nREMY: Uh, on Beck?\nCODY: Yeah.\nREMY: She’s not really used to being a shuttle dragon.\nCODY: She seems nice, though, maybe she’d want to help people out.\nREMY: I mean, yeah, we just… I don’t know, kind of like our thing. Haven’t really thought about doing a career change to shuttle work. I mean, I could do it, if things, uh…\nAlan: Cody’s eyes have glossed over.\nOliver: Yeah, Remy kind of rambles on about career trajectories for a while. He’s not great at talking.\nCODY: Okay, but really, how many people?\nREMY: Oh, um, I think shuttle dragons when they’re fully outfitted can carry probably like… 30? 30 people, maybe? Probably about 30. Beck here—we’ve never went that route, I mean, she can carry a couple tons of gear. She’s pretty sturdy, aren’t ya, Beck?\nOliver: And he’s like, scratching the toothbrush thing on her butt where she’s covered in mud, and he’s like,\nREMY: You’re so gross. Anyway, why’d you ask?\nCODY: Oh, uhhhhh…\nAlan: And Cody looks over at Max like trying to like, play it cool.\nCODY: Um, no reason. Just curious. Never seen a dragon before. Uh…\nREMY: Oh, okay.\nAllison: Meanwhile, behind the house, Erica has followed Zan.\nERICA: So, that guy’s leaving. As far as I can tell on this map, it’s gonna take a week for us to get anywhere else that there’s civilization. Do you know where that path of the gray jumpsuit was going?\nZAN: I mean, roughly south, but that’s about all we know. If we’re following a trail, it could suddenly sort of change directions a little bit. \nAllison: Erica is kind of looking back and forth and says,\nERICA: Right, um, so here’s the question. Do we want to go down to the nearest town or do we want to continue following that jumpsuit? Because I feel like I came out of the tube and you were the de facto leader, a little bit. Um, so…\nAllison: And she’s like wringing her hands at this point, and she says,\nERICA: I… I don’t know what we should do.\nJASMIN: Meow.\n[Laughter]\nTalia: Zan’s pretty taken aback by the fact that she’s the de facto leader. Um…\nOliver: Jasmin, make a wisdom saving throw at advantage.\nAlice: Alright.\n[Dice rolls]\nAlice: That would be a 9 and a 12.\nOliver: Okay, at this point you’ve kind of shaken off the effects of being like, super into being a cat, and you are just sitting in Erica’s arms at this point. Curled up there, it’s warm, you’re in the sun, and you realize that oh, wait, you know Erica, and you know Zan, and you can hear and understand everything that they’re saying.\nAlice: Okay.\nZAN: I don’t… we should follow the scraps, right? Like they’re the only lead we’ve got to anything, right?\nERICA: Right. Um, I guess the thing is—do we know that the hunter is someone we can trust and someone that will help us, or is figuring out those coordinates going to be the best move?\nZAN: I don’t know. I’m worried that we’re going to get to a bigger town and we’re going to be so incredibly out of place that we’re going to get into a lot of trouble or something. We don’t know anything the customs or anything. It’s like when I play the third installment of a video game and I don’t know any of the history and then I accidentally fuck up everything by siding with the wrong side that everybody else knows is bad. That make sense?\nAlice: I think, Erica, you can kind of feel Jasmin’s fur stand a little on edge, as if she’s getting really nervous listening to this.\nZAN: I just… I don’t know. I get the forest, it makes sense.\nERICA: Okay.\nZAN: But uh, if you want to get back to civilization like—\n{49:11}\nERICA: No, I mean, I don’t know what the hell we’re doing. But if you think we should keep following those scraps then let’s do that.\nAllison: And Erica kind of absent-mindedly starts stroking the cat that is in her arms.\nOliver: Aw, she’s very soft. Actually, Erica, make a strength saving throw.\n[Dice rolls]\nAllison: That is a 7.\nOliver: Yeah, you collapse as suddenly you are holding Jasmin, bridal-style, like sideways. \n[Laughter]\nOliver: And you fall, and she’s on top of you, and yep, you’re in the dirt now.\nERICA: Oh shit!\nJasmin: Oh my god, I’m so sorry! Are you okay?\nERICA: Yeah, uh, I think I was startled more than anything. Um, welcome back, glad to have you here. Welcome to the discussion. Were you able to understand us? I don’t know how this works.\nJASMIN: No, I was—I followed most of it, but I got a little distracted by a bug at first, but, um, I understood it.\nZAN: I don’t… hm. Yeah, okay. Are you sure you’re okay with not going to the city?\nERICA: I mean, we don’t know what’s going to be there. We don’t know anything. And my gut isn’t telling me that I need to be anywhere specific. I don’t know. If we can figure out a good hiking situation, then I think this will work fine.\nJASMIN: I’m a little scared of getting locked up. It sounded like… what, if they can figure it out somehow? Like, there’s someone there who has some magical goggles and can see shifters. In the forest, I think I’m at least somewhat safe.\nERICA: Yeah, that’s fair. Counterpoint: we’re following a trail for a man called The Hunter.\nZAN: Maybe it’s just like a name, like, you know, Hunter. I feel like there’s people who call their kids Hunter.\nJASMIN: How many people call their kids “The?”\n[Laughter]\nZAN: Well, I don’t know! Did you feel the instinct to be like “I got a cool new fantasy name in this world?” I know I felt a little bit of that.\nJASMIN: What would your call new fantasy name be?\nZAN: Uhm… I mean, I hadn’t thought about it that much.\nJASMIN: See? Then The Hunter is kind of weird.\nZAN: But like, if your name was already Hunter…\nJASMIN: Well, you don’t see me changing my name to Jasmin Plant and my name is already Jasmin.\nZAN: That would be kind of a cool name though.\nAllison: Erica just gently whispers to herself,\nERICA: [quietly] The Erica.\n[10 full seconds of laughter]\nERICA: I don’t know. I don’t want to encroach on Lili and Nula and Windred’s time too much, you know?\nAllison: And Erica’s looking nervous again.\nJASMIN: No, I get it. They’ve been really nice. There’s a lot of us. They have just a cute, cozy house, and I was thinking overwhelmed I would be if 5 strangers suddenly showed up… [shudders]\nZAN: Yeah, no, I think leaving makes sense. You know, we can hopefully maybe come back someday and repay them in some way?\nERICA: Yeah.\nJASMIN: That would be nice.\nERICA: Maybe we can find out how to contact Remy. If we get to Fell’s Keep, we can ask Remy how we can find him. And maybe we can catch a ride back here if we need to.\nJASMIN: A pink dragon sounds like it would be very notable and probably easy to find.\nZAN: I don’t know, maybe there’s lots of pink dragons in towns here. Maybe it’s the new thing.\nOliver: Just every family has their own pink dragon. The houses are enormous.\nAllison: Erica points up at the sky and says,\nERICA: We woke up to two suns this morning. I don’t know what’s usual anywhere anymore.\nZAN: Yeah, that’s… we know nothing.\nJASMIN: Yeah, the two suns kind of put a dent in my apocalyptic future thing.\nZAN: Right? I thought the same thing.\nOliver: The 3 of you, huddled talking behind the house, hear someone clear their throat and you look up and you see Nula is kind of leaning out the window, and they wave down at you.\nNULA: Hi.\nZAN: Hey.\nNULA: I might be able to help with some of your problems. Come meet me over by Remy.\nOliver: And they disappear back into the house.\nJASMIN: Oh no, they were listening?\nERICA: Well, I guess let’s go.\nTalia: We go find Nula.\nOliver: Okay, great.\nCODY: And then Hiccup made new this new tail fin for Toothless—\n[Laughter]\nCODY: And then they could fly together, and then they work together, and they figured out how to make where like—humans weren’t afraid of dragons anymore, and they became friends! And that’s how the first movie ended. And then there was a second movie, and—\nOliver: Remy is like, crouched down next to Cody who is telling him the plot of How to Train Your Dragon and is totally enraptured. And’s he like,\nREMY: Yeah, okay, what happens in the second movie?\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Yeah, they look like they’re having actually a pretty good time. As Erica, Jasmin, and Zan reappear on the side of the house, they see Nula walking across the clearing towards where everyone else is standing near the dragon, who has finished chewing on the tree and is just laying on her side in the sun.\nAlice: Oliver, question. Am I covered in dirt?\nOliver: Yeah, yes. Not covered—like, you didn’t roll in mud or anything. But yeah, you’re pretty dirty.\nAlice: Yeah.\nOliver: Might want to dust off your skirt.\nAllison: Dusty Jasmin.\nRobot: While Cody is telling the story, Max is gonna walk over to the dragon and like, very cautiously try to put a hand on a foot.\nOliver: Yeah, you walk up and see the dragon following you with her eyes and you walk over and cautiously reach out and put a hand on her foot. She’s got like, big clawed feet, and she immediately snaps her head up and over and bumps it right into your chest. Make a strength saving throw.\nRobot: Oh god.\n[Dice rolls]\nRobot: That is… 10.\nOliver: Yeah, you stumble back a little bit. She just kind of like bumped you on the chest and let out a big breath on you, just kind of like…\n[Deep breath]\nOliver: No idea how that audio is going to sound.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: She kind of cocks her head and looks at you and then bumps you again, and this time you’re expecting it. She just seems to enjoy bumping you in the chest with her nose.\nRobot: I’m gonna try to pet her under the chin like a dog.\nOliver: Oh, she fucking loves that. Yeah, as soon as you start scratching under the there her whole head tilts back, and you gotta use both hands at this point because her head is the size of a small car. But yeah, you get under there and you see one of her back legs lift up and just start flailing in the air. She loves that.\nRobot: Yeah, Max just spends the rest of the time petting this dragon everywhere.\nOliver: She thinks this is great, this is the best day. The rest of you make it over to the group. You see Max under the dragon’s chin, just scratching away. You see Remy and Cody sitting on a patch of moss with Cody animatedly telling Remy the plot of How to Train Your Dragon 2, which Remy loves. Nula waves you all closer and they look at Remy and they say,\nNULA: Uh, Remy.\nOliver: And Remy’s like,\nREMY: Oh, uh, pause on the story. Hey, Auntie Nula.\nOliver: And he goes over and gives them a kiss on the forehead and a little hug and then stands back.\nNULA: It’s very good to see you. Um, I was wondering if, when you were down in any city, have you heard any rumors about The Hunter?\nOliver: And Remy like, tilts his head back.\nREMY: Uh, oh, yeah, I did actually. I think there was a guy in Capitol, got into some bad, bad trouble down there. Few different rumors. I heard some guy called himself The Hunter with this other fella, older fella with him. They maybe got involved in some fighting rings. I don’t know how true that one is, you know how everybody likes to pretend everyone else is in the secret underground fight ring. Another person said “Maybe killed a guard?” and I heard a few people saying the old fella he had with him was a shifter and fucking exploded or something. I don’t know true that—you know how people are with the shifters. As far as I know, he was barred from the Capitol, maybe the whole kingdom. I don’t know, it’s like a year ago, six months, something?\nOliver: And Nula nods to this, and at you, Zan.\nNULA: Can I talk to you for a moment?\nZAN: Yeah, yeah, sure.\nOliver: They kind of pull you away, and you hear Lili behind you be like,\nLILI: And also what happened with the wrestling ring? Did they ever figure out who was running it, or did they solve the mystery?\nOliver: And she’s very excitedly waiting for more hot goss from Remy, who indulges her. But yeah, Nula leads you away from the group for a minute and says,\nNULA: I think there’s something weird going on with the 5 of you.\n[Laughter]\nNULA: To put it bluntly.\nZAN: Yeah.\nNULA: So um, a guy calling himself The Hunter passed through here. Well, right after he passed through, we had some strange… attacks? I don’t know. The wildlife seemed to get pretty riled up when he came through here. That golem you fought last night… that’s not normal for us. And so, to my best account, kind of piecing together what little information I have…\nZAN: You think we’re attracting weird animals.\nNULA: Maybe. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but um, I worry for you, if you were to walk all the way down there. The growth isn’t a forgiving place. I think you should, uh, you should take a ride from Remy down to town. I think it’ll be safer that way. And it sounds like The Hunter made it down there.\nZAN: Right, you’re probably right. I just don’t… I felt so weird last night, just like, inside. I felt stuck.\n{60:05}\nNULA: Oh, uh—\nZAN: I don’t necessarily want to go to town, I just…\nNULA: Ah, I’m sorry, I should’ve asked you last night. There’s a bed made up in the greenhouse where I usually sleep. Could’ve had you sleep out there. I just like being with plants, and sometimes the house gets too stuffy for me. You get that. Fell’s Keep is, uh… I haven’t been there in a while, but it will probably be a bit of a struggle for you, if that’s how you’re feeling. The Capitol is green and nice, I think you’ll like it.\nZAN: Okay.\nOliver: She puts a hand on your shoulder and gives it a squeeze and says,\nNULA: You’re tough, you’ll manage.\nZAN: All right. Thanks, Nula.\nNULA: You’re welcome.\nOliver: And then they turn back and walk over to everybody, where Lili and Remy are now listening to Cody’s explanation of the plot of the hit DreamWorks movie.\nTalia: Yeah.\nAlan: And once he gets to a certain point in movie 3, where like, lots of humans are riding on lots of dragons, Cody just stops in the middle of the story,\nCODY: Wait. Uh, hey guys? Come here real quick.\nZAN: Uh-huh.\nCODY: So, uh, stay with me. But I asked Remy earlier if Beck could carry people and he was a little wishy-washy on it, but I took the answer to be a general yes.\nREMY: [quietly] I mean, I think I was pretty concise but okay.\n[Laughter]\nCODY: What if instead of walking all that way and being so bored, what if flew on a dragon down to… somewhere? That place we’re going? Are we going to a place?\nZAN: That’s a great idea, Cody.\nAlan: And Cody is surprised his idea was accepted. Like,\nCODY: Really? \nJASMIN: Yeah, it’s a great idea. We… none of us thought of it.\nZAN: Yeah, it’s uh, wow.\nCODY: I’m gonna be like Hiccup!\nAlan: And Cody just starts jumping up and down, maybe kind of getting closer to Max and the dragon.\nZAN: All right, all right, keep your legs on.\nAllison: Erica looks at Zan like bewildered and confused that the plan has changed.\nTalia: Zan just kind of puts a hand to her forehead and closes her eyes and makes some sort of gesture like “we’ll talk about this later, just go with it.”\nAllison: Erica nods and is looking so confused and anxious.\nOliver: Great. You see that Nula has pulled Remy aside and is like talking to him in low voices and Remy looks up at the 5 of you and nods at Nula.\nREMY: So um, you want a ride to town?\nZAN: Yeah, that’d be great.\nREMY: All right. Auntie Nula, do you think you could do the thing again?\nOliver: And Nula nods. So Nula walks off toward the tree line and makes like a [tongue click] noise, gestures to Beck, who excitedly gets up, kind of bowls Max over in the process and follows Nula over to the trees. Nula positions her next to this like, knotted and gnarled tree that’s covered in vines, and you watch as you put their hand on the tree and close their eyes.\nAlice: Oliver, as I see this, can I try to join in and help her?\nOliver: Yes. Okay, Jasmin, quietly half-jog over to the tree where Nula is standing and they look up at you.\nAlice: I gesture at the tree and make a questioning face, like “can I?”\nOliver: They put your hand on the tree and put their hand over top of yours, and they say,\nNULA: Close your eyes, and just breathe when I breathe.\nOliver: And the two of you breathe in unison, and you feel the tree start to move. And the rest of you watch as the branches of the tree creak and turn and start to snake over the dragon’s back, and they’re twisting and reforming. And you watch as Nula, with Jasmin’s help, coaxes the wood out of the ground and into the shape of five seats on the dragon’s back, the vine snake under the dragon’s belly, securing this big contraption to her. She fidgets a little bit but then is chill. Nula pants your hand, Jasmin, and is like,\nNULA: You helped a little bit. You gotta work on it, but you’ll get there.\nJASMIN: Thank you.\nNULA: You’re welcome.\nAlan: Cody’s jumping up and down. He sees the new seats, he’s like “it’s coming true!” He’s gonna ride a dragon. He’s like,\nCODY: Woohoo!\nAlan: And he runs up to Lili.\nCODY: Lili, Lili! We’re gonna ride a dragon, we’re going to go take a dragon to a town! Aaaaa!\nLILI: You are, you are!\nOliver: And she just picks you up and throws you in the air and then catches you, like you would do with a toddler.\nCODY: I’m so excited! And when we get there, can you show me around town? And can we go do some stuff and really explore it?\nLILI: Oh, um… oh, Cody. Um… I’m gonna stay out here. Um…\nCODY: Wha—\nLILI: I’m going to stay here, uh, this is my house, where I live.\nCODY: [sadly] Oh.\nLILI: But I’m sure I’ll see you again, and you’ll have so much fun in town! Um, the uh, oh—the start of summer festival is coming up. Remy, do they still celebrate the start of summer festival?\nREMY: Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, in Fell’s Keep they’ll have, like, a thing.\nLILI: Flowers in your hair and you can get lots of candy and go play games and it’ll be wonderful! You’ll have so much fun.\nCODY: Oh, um… thank you for letting us stay here. Um—\nLILI: Oh, you’re so welcome! Thank you for coming to visit, we haven’t had visitors in a very long time. And Cody,\nOliver: And she leans in close and she’s like,\nLILI: You are my favorite visitor. You can always come here, okay?\nCODY: Okay. Before I go, can I ask you two things? Just two.\nLILI: Yes.\nCODY: Okay, um… first is, you’ve told us about The Hunter, and you’ve told us about town and everything that you know. Is it safe?\nLILI: Oh, yes, yes. Actually, out here is probably one of the more dangerous places that you’ll be. Most people don’t live out here in the growth like we do, they settle into towns where they have nice, strong walls and they burn down the growth around them so nothing can sneak up. You’ll be very safe there, and it seems like your friends really care about you, so they’ll keep you safe.\nCODY: Oh, okay.\nAlan: He’s a little bit more relaxed. And he goes,\nCODY: Lastly, and you’ve been so nice and I don’t want to ask you for too much, but remember when I was sick and I was feeling a little blue earlier?\nLILI: Yes.\nCODY: Um, you gave me some medicine and…\nLILI: Oh, yes!\nCODY: And I don’t know what other things are out there that might hurt me, but, like, do you have more medicine in case?\nLILI: Oh, let me see, let me see.\nOliver: And she’s like,\nLILI: Come on, come on.\nOliver: And she takes you by the hand and leads you towards the big glass geodesic dome. And as you get up to the outside you see that it’s kind of foggy in there and she puts a hand on the edge of the dome and the piece of glass that’s there just rumbles for a second and then slides into the ground. And you see the inside of this huge greenhouse just full of plants, and she’s still holding your hand and leads you over to a desk.\nLILI: So, uh, I write this book, and you can find it in some shops in the kingdom. I don’t have any extra copies, I just have the notes that I’ve made and then I hand them off. But I do have some notes.\nOliver: You see her draw some pages out of a pile, and she stacks them together and she says,\nLILI: Um, these ones are the most “hit,” or “hip,” I don’t know what the kids say. “Cool“ plants of the region.\n[Laughter]\nLILI: These ones come in extra handy, and I would like you to have these.\nOliver: And she gives you about 6 pages of drawings of plants with little notes written beside them and drawings of vials or things like that.\nAlan: He’ll gladly take them and open up his backpack and his notebook and store the notes in one of his school notebooks where his papers are. Once he’s in there, he looks at it and he looks up at Lili real quick, and he carefully pulls out another piece of paper from the middle of the notebook.\nCODY: Um, I don’t have anything useful, but here’s a drawing I did this morning?\nAlan: And it’s just a really rough drawing of their house with the 3 of them and with all of our party out front.\nOliver: Aww!\nAlan: And maybe a really rough rock golem outside.\nOliver: Is the rock golem angry or smiling?\n[Laughter]\nTalia: Or dead?\nOliver: Or dead!\nAlan: It’s on the ground with x’s over its eyes.\nOliver: Okay, great!\n[Laughter]\nOliver: She takes this page from you and tears are welling up in her eyes and she’s like,\nLILI: [tearfully] Oh my gosh, I like it so much! Oh my gosh!\nAlan: In the middle of the reaction he goes up and gives, I guess, probably one of her legs the biggest hug he can muster.\nOliver: Oh, she scoops you up and just picks you up and hugs you and gives you like 40 kisses all of your little face. And’s she like,\nLILI: You’re my favorite little guest ever!\nAlan: He’s like,\nCODY: Oh, uh, eh, uh, thanks, thanks Lili.\nOliver: Your hair is ruffled.\nCODY: You’re really kind, and I’m gonna miss you.\nLILI: Thank you, Cody. So are you. And I’m gonna miss you too.\nAlan: And the moment that she puts him on the ground, he’s gonna just take off running, putting his backpack on back and catching up with the group.\nOliver: So you’re all standing in the clearing. Remy has gone around and checked the vines that are holding these wooden makeshift chairs in place on Beck’s back, and he has reattached the saddle to just behind her head. He looks at the five of you and says,\nREMY: So um, ready to go? I gotta meet somebody later today, so can’t stay much longer.\nZAN: Yeah, I think we’re ready.\nJASMIN: [uncertainly] Uh-huh.\nREMY: All right. Uh, Lili, you help me give them a hand up?\nOliver: And so Lili and Remy help you up onto the dragon’s back. Then as you go up, one by one, Remy jumps up there with you and he’s got a length of sturdy rope that he uses to fashion seatbelts around you so you’re solidly tied in. He leaves little a knot of it on your lap so you can untie yourself if you want to.\nTalia: So it’s not too kinky?\nOliver: It’s not kinky. One of you is a child.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Okay, wait, sorry. He does Cody first, it’s not kinky. The rest of you, it’s as kinky as you want it to be. Do you want to make a kinky check? Is that what this is?\n[Laughter]\nAlice: Now that’s a podcast name.\nTalia: Yes, and…\nOliver: All right, roll a d20.\n[Dice rolls]\nTalia: Aw, that’s a 6.\nOliver: Zan, it’s not kinky for you. You feel uncomfortable. This man is tying you down like you were a child in a child seat, and that is not one of your things.\nTalia: I fucking hate car seats, they’re the worst.\nOliver: Anyone else roll a kinky check?\nRobot: Mine’s a 12.\nAlice: Yeah, I got a 10.\nOliver: Yeah, Jasmin, you’re like “oh, this is kind of nice.”\n[Laughter]\nTalia: It feels secure!\nAlice: Yeah, Jasmin feels a little bit safer now.\nOliver: Yeah, yeah. You feel nice. Max, you get tied to your chair and you’re like “oh!” And that’s all.\n[Laughter]\nRobot: Yep.\nOliver: You rolled a 12, you get 20% of a boner. Erica, did you roll a kinky check?\nAllison: [reluctantly] I could roll a kinky check. Do I have any pluses to kinky checks?\n[Dice rolls]\nOliver: You have your charisma.\nAllison: Um, in that case I got a 4.\nOliver: Um, yeah. He kind of tightens it too tight. And you get a little bit of a rug burn on your arm, and you’re like “ah! I hated that!” And he’s like,\nREMY: Oh, sorry, I don’t do this. Uh, okay, goodbye.\nOliver: And it’s very awkward. He jumps down off of Beck’s back where the 5 of you are strapped like in an old wooden rollercoaster. Remy takes a moment, gives Lili another hug, same with Nula. He like, bends down and gives Windred a kiss on the head. Windred has been drinking from a cup of tea and not helping with anything and just scowling at everybody, and you hear her as Remy says bye, she’s like,\nWINDRED: It’s too early. Next time come in the afternoon. Going back to bed, this sucks. Bye idiots!\nOliver: And she gives a half-hearted wave at the dragon and just trudges back towards the house.\nRobot: Max yells,\nMAX: Bye coach!\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Lili and Nula take a step back. Remy climbs up onto the saddle and you feel the dragon’s enormous body lurch under you as she unfurls her wings and leaps. Your stomachs drop out as you watch the ground fall away. You’re rising higher and higher. The tiny house in the woods gets smaller and eventually is lost in the sea of trees beneath you. After what feels like an eternity, the jarring flapping of wings evens out into a peaceful glide. You’re strapped to the back of the dragon with a strange new world a mile beneath you. Remy turns around in his seat and gives you a thumbs up as you look at the world.\n=== START ENDROLL ===\nAllison: You can find us on Twitter, @DiceDisasters, and we have more information about the show and the cast at dicedisasters.com.\nAlan: Our website was made by Allison Otting, who plays Erica.\nOliver: Dice Disasters is edited by Alan Brazzell, who plays Cody.\nRobot: Our cover art is made by our DM, Oliver Northwood.\nTalia: Our theme song is by People Need Goals who you can find on BandCamp or on Twitter @peopleneedgoals.
