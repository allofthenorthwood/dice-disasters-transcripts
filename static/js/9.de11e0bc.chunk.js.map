You're standing in the server room huddled together around Erica's dancing lights and the glow of Cody's jumpsuit. You're tired and you're hungry. Zan is slumped against one of the server racks, holding a hand to her throbbing head. The strange mechanical arm that called itself CASTR is now hanging stationery from the ceiling. Jasmin's hands tremble as she holds the black metal backup box, given to you by CASTR, along with a quest. Close the rift, bring this box to the sister facility, and she will send you home. In Max's notebook you have the coordinates CASTR gave you for that second facility. What do you do?\n=== INTRO THEME: “Elysia” by People Need Goals ===\nAlice:\nI take the box and I put it in my shoulder bag. I look around at everyone, probably in like a weird, flickering sort of light from all of the weird, different magic lights that are happening. And see how tired everyone is and how hurt everyone is. And Jasmin says--\nJASMIN:\nUh, I know that this is not a very nice place, but I think we should stay here for at least, like, the night or something? I don't think we're in a good state to leave.\nERICA:\nThat's fair.\nJASMIN:\nWe could find a place to sleep.\nZAN:\nYeah.\nERICA:\nI think that's a good idea.\nAllison:\nDo we even have any concept of what time of day it is?\nAlan:\nWould we know how long have we been, like-- If we had to get a general guess as to how long we've been awake? Can we we figure out an idea and a good estimate?\nOliver:\nWhat check would that be?\nAlice:\nNature?\nAlan:\nMaybe perception? Just perceiving time... the passage of time?\nOliver:\n[Laughs] There is time. Yes.\nRobot:\nI would say intelligence or nature.\nOliver:\nYeah, I'd say make an intelligence check.\nAlan:\nThat's a nine.\nOliver:\nYou'd guess more than six hours. More than six hours, less than 20.\nCODY:\nI mean, yeah, I guess. I mean, we've been running around and doing a lotta stuff. I guess we could take a nap? But, you know, aren't we done? Isn't it time to go home?\nJASMIN:\nThis... well...\nAlice:\nJasmin sits down a little bit.\nJASMIN:\nWe don't know where home is from here, Cody.\nCODY:\nI mean, we have to be somewhere in town. Maybe we're, like, over by the stadium or downtown... Maybe it's a new part of Worlds of Fun! We can't be too far.\nZAN:\nWhat town are you talking about?\nMAX:\nA tiny baby.\nCODY:\nWhere we live. Don't... Don't we all live-- Don't we all live in Kansas City?\nZAN:\nHa ha ha.\nMAX:\nMm. No.\nJASMIN:\nIs that the one from Dorothy?\nCODY:\nI don't think so. She had a farm. Where are y'all from?\nZAN:\nNot Kansas City, I can tell you that. I think I was there once. Like a layover.\nCODY:\nOh, OK.\nJASMIN:\nI am from Vienna.\nZAN:\nAustria?\nJASMIN:\nYes.\nCODY:\nWhere is that? I guess I don't know where we are.\nERICA:\nI am not nearly that exotic. I am from Oregon.\nZAN:\nOh hey, I'm up in Seattle.\nERICA:\nOh, cool. I am just down in Monmouth.\nZAN:\nI'm actually from Tacoma. But that's the same thing.\nJASMIN:\nYou are all Americans.\nMAX:\nUh, yeah, I'm from-- I'm from Rhode Island.\nJASMIN:\nI think-- I guess that's in America, too?\nERICA:\nJust a bunch of Americans and one... I'm guessing you're Austrian if you live in Vienna? But I don't want to assume.\nJASMIN:\nI am.\nERICA:\nCool. Cool.\nJASMIN:\nIt's kind of unlikely, isn't it? You would think that if it was a random selection of humans, it would be like three Chinese women, and an Indian, and like-- an African person.\nZAN:\nWell, you got one Chinese woman, but I don't live there. So. Ah, can we, like, just, like, sit for a bit?\nERICA:\nYeah.\nZAN:\nUntil my head stops hurting.\nERICA:\nI have so far seen two rooms since I woke up. Is there any other place that you guys know of that would be more conducive to taking a little bit of a break?\nMAX:\nWhat if we went back to the good room?\nJASMIN:\nThe room with the gel beds?\nMAX:\nYeah, with--\nCODY:\nThe goo beds!\nMAX:\nWith the robot.\nJASMIN:\nThe room where the robot threw us in goo.\nMAX:\nYeah, The room with the good robot. Not the bad robot.\nCODY:\nYeah, the goo beds!\nJASMIN:\nThat's a good idea.\nZAN:\nLet's go.\nOliver:\nAre you going?\nTalia:\nYeah.\nAllison:\nDoo doo doo doop!\nTalia:\nStar wipe.\nOliver:\nBefore the last lights shut off, you saw CASTR open the airlock door to this room and she said that she had opened all the other ones. So you go back out into the hallway of level B2. It's dark and you can only see about 30 feet, in either direction using the light of your spells. But you can easily get to the stairwell door that leads both up and downwards. So do you back up to B1?\nAlan:\nYes. Uh, yeah. Oliver. This is Player Alan speaking.\nOliver:\nHi Player Alan!\nAlan:\nUm, you just help me remember what you literally told us, like five minutes ago in game time, as to what levels the exits are on? I just can't remember for future reference.\nOliver:\nYes, I will do this. Before the last of the lights shut off, you watched as CASTR opened the airlock door. She also mentioned the elevator shaft that you saw on level B1 is now open, and that could be a way out. There's also a few maintenance tunnels that start on B5, that could serve as exits. You're currently on level B2. So, you know there is an elevator door on level B1 and she told you there is also a door to that elevator on B5. You have access to a stairwell that leads up to B1 as well as downward.\nTalia:\nB1 also has the goo room, right?\nOliver:\nYes.\nTalia:\nSo why don't we go up there?\nOliver:\nOkay, so the four of you who have been upstairs before lead Erica down the hallway and into this stairwell. In the stairwell it says B2, and there is a map of this floor that shows the server room and the labs. If you go upstairs, you arrive at the end of the stairwell. This is as far up as it goes. It says Level B1, and as you enter the hallway, you're in a spacious concrete hallway. At one end is a huge airlock that is now open. So it is just a big hole leading into a vertical tunnel. There's no elevator car there. There's also a staircase that leads upwards, and you remember that leads to that control room that didn't have another exit. And a door that leads to a circular room filled with weird old medical equipment that is all pushed to the edges of the room. In the center of this room there are five strange looking beds. They're more like trays, about six inches deep, filled with a blue slime that in the dark you can see is faintly glowing. That's what's in this dark room.\nAlan:\nCody runs up to the beds and just hops in one.\nOliver:\nOkay, great. So, Cody, you jump up onto a bed and you sit in this goo. And it's not like sticky goo. It's almost like those memory foam mattresses, and it just molds to your shape--\nAlan:\nQuestion. Can you jump on the bed? Um, is it bouncable or does it take all your momentum? Can Cody jump on this bed?\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nUm... I don't think it would be fun to jump on.\nAlan:\nCan Cody try?\nOliver:\nYeah. You jump on it. Make an acrobatics check.\nAlice:\nRole for jump.\nAlan:\nOkay. Seven.\nOliver:\nYou hop up there. You do one big jump and your feet kind of get stuck in the goo, and you fall off the bed, hit your head on one of the other beds and take five points of bludgeoning damage.\n[Exclaims of surprise]\nAlice:\nFive???\nTalia:\nGod, go back to bed.\nOliver:\nYou hear a loud \"thwack!\" as Cody just whacks his head into one of the other metal trays.\nAlan:\nOh, you hear this child as he runs over yell--\nCODY:\nHey, look at this!\nAlan:\n--as he runs.\nZAN:\nNone of us are ever allowed to say \"Hey, look at this anymore.\"\nJASMIN:\nNo, it always goes poorly.\nAlice:\nWe're gonna have to make a super cut at some point, like a bunch of episodes down the line, of every single character saying, \"Hey, look at this\" and something going wrong.\nOliver:\nYou guys look at Cody. Uh, he's got a cut above his left eyebrow.\nCODY:\nOw...\nZAN:\nGo back into the bed.\nCODY:\nWhy--\nZAN:\nWe don't do that. Go back into the bed.\nCODY:\nI wanted to... I wanted to jump on it.\nZAN:\nGo back into the bed. No jumping.\nCODY:\n[Dejected] Okay.\nAlan:\nHe climbs up on the bed, then he's gonna roll over, face down.\nZAN:\nOh, god-- Can you breathe like that?\nAlan:\nHe turns his head to the side and says--\nCODY:\nIt's OK.\nOliver:\nCody, as you lay there, that holographic screen doesn't pop up like it did last time, but you watch as the glow of the bed starts to fade, and you regain four hit points and one spell slot as you're laying there. And you watch this on your own wristband. There's no extra holographic screen. It seems like the power has been shut off.\nRobot:\nOh, shit. You said there were five beds, right?\nOliver:\nYes.\nRobot:\nOkay. Well.\nOliver:\nAlan, you are now at 9 hit points.\nJASMIN:\nOkay, Erica, these are healing beds. Um, we kind of got thrown into them by that robot. That's in a pile over there. Uh, we thought we were being attacked, but it turns out they're actually very helpful.\nERICA:\nNeat. Cool.\nZAN:\nBut we did beat it up, so it is no longer functional.\nERICA:\nEven better.\nAllison:\nErica pulls open her menu and she says,\nERICA:\nI have this thing called Song of Rest. I'm like, reading through it and it looks like it might help us like hell up a little bit before we move on. I could try that? And maybe maybe we could all feel a little bit better after we take a nap.\nJASMIN:\nThat sounds goods.\nCODY:\nThe bed feels like it helped a little bit. My my head feels a little better. So maybe that will help too.\nZAN:\nMaybe we should try the beds first, see what we can get out of them, because we don't want to waste your spells.\nERICA:\nCool. Great.\nJASMIN:\nI also actually wanted to look through some of the building? I mean, it's-- it should be safe now, right? There's no power. And I kind of wanted to look at the plant that we found. Do you want to come look with up the plant with me, Zan?\nZAN:\nSure. Yeah, we can go. Look at that. Can I just try out the bed real quick? First?\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nZan does not look so hot right now.\nAllison:\nZan is about to fall over.\nJASMIN:\nYeah, of course.\nZAN:\nGonna, Just... just--\nTalia:\nZan, like, tries to get up into the bed and has to stop for a second, like, mid jump up onto the bed and just kind of--\nOliver:\nFlops down on there?\nTalia:\nYeah.\nAlice:\nI can help her!\nOliver:\nAnd you help her upon the bed.\nZAN:\nNo, no, I'm good. It's fine. Uh, don't worry about it. I'm cool.\nTalia:\nZan gets into the bed. Does she feel any better?\nOliver:\nShe feels a little better. She regains four hit points and one spell slot. And the glow from that bed also dissipates.\nTalia:\nOkay.\nOliver:\nIt's still soft. Is still comfortable. But it's not healing you.\nTalia:\nOh, no, that-- I moved my hit points down. That's bad.\nOliver:\nWhoops, Zan died!\nTalia:\nOh no!\n[Laughter]\nAlice:\nI will just lie in mine too, for good measure.\nOliver:\nOkay. You also get four hit points and a spell slot and feel a little better. It takes about five minutes.\nRobot:\nI'll just look over at Erica and be like--\nMAX:\nLady's choice. Take one of the two.\nERICA:\nUm, yeah, I guess I'll get in one.\nAllison:\nAnd so Erica jumps in one too.\nRobot:\nI'll get in the other one.\nOliver:\nGreat. You both regain four hit points and one spell slot. You no longer feel achingly hungry or achingly tired. But those thoughts are still in your head of like, \"Man, a burger would be great right now. Also a nap.\"\nAllison:\nDo I get any of my abilities back?\nOliver:\nNo.\nAllison:\nDo I get my spell slot back too?\nOliver:\nYes. You gain one spell slot back.\nAllison:\nHell, yeah.\nERICA:\nOK. Do we wanna-- How's everybody feeling? Do we want to take a little nap to or do we want to get going?\nJASMIN:\nI'd like to take a look around the building. There's places we didn't go, and it sounded like it was very dangerous outside. And there was something weird going on with that plants that I saw. And...\nZAN:\nYeah, I can go check out the plant with you if you want it like that.\nJASMIN:\nI'd like that.\nZAN:\nAll right.\nOliver:\nAre you going to split up or all go?\nTalia:\nI mean, I don't know how interested anybody else is in this plant.\nAlice:\nIt's literally just like a plant.\nAllison:\nHow is Cody doing? Is he's still bleeding from the head?\nOliver:\nNo, he's got a smear of blood across his face where he wiped it. But the cut is sealed up on his head. He looks fine.\nAllison:\nCool.\nOliver:\nChipper.\nAlan:\nYeah, he's feeling good. He just enjoys laying down. And so as long as there's still people in the room, he's not gonna get up from bed.\nRobot:\nMax is absolutely doing the same. Until people leave I'm in that bed.\nOliver:\nThe two boys are laying down being like, \"Bedtime?\"\nTalia:\nZan gets out of the bed as soon as physically possible. As soon as as the little like, \"your spell slots\" has pinged.\nOliver:\nAll right, great.\nZAN:\nI don't like those beds.\nAllison:\nErica is going to stay in bed as well, and explore, her little wrist menu 'cause it's all very, very new to her still.\nOliver:\nOkay, great. So to recap the doors in this room-- this is a big circular room. On one side is the door you came through that leads to the hallway with the elevator shaft and the stairwell. And then on the other side of the room are six airlock doors, and they are all open. You remember that they were numbered 1 through 6. And as you look down the first hallway, you see a long hallway and it opens up into a room, and it's all dark down there. So you don't know what that is. And most of them are like that. They're just long hallways that open up into a room. But they're dark. I'm going to be describing a lot of things as \"dark.\"\nTalia:\nYeah, yeah.\nAlice:\nIf it's all right, I'll just make a ball of flame in my hands, to light it up.\nOliver:\nAll right. In Jasmin's open palm, you see a handful of flames appear. Kinda like, purple-y in color. It's pretty.\nJASMIN:\nShall we?\nZAN:\nYes.\nOliver:\nOkay. Which which tunnel are you going down?\nAlice:\nThe one we remember coming from?\nTalia:\nYeah.\nOliver:\nYou follow this long hallway and pass through more open airlock doors. You reach a large room with some signs of a scuffle on the floor. And you put together that this is where you battled that sword automaton the first time. And then you pass through another long hallway and you reach a room with what used to be a giant electric wall. This room is now basically empty.\nZAN:\nOh electric wall room. I don't miss you.\nOliver:\nWhere Zan almost fucking died.\nZAN:\nThat was kind of bad.\nZAN:\nFor no reason.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nYeah. You find the tile on the floor that is slightly raised where one of you had spotted a plant that was growing underneath it. And where you lost Wrenchie.\nTalia:\nAh, yes.\nRobot:\nF.\nAlan:\nRIP.\nTalia:\nRest in peace. Uh, can we do an investigation check?\nOliver:\nSure. Roll an investigation check with advantage. Whichever one of you wants to roll it. Yeah. Go for it.\nAlice:\nUh, my investigation is plus 2.\nTalia:\nPlease, you go.\nOliver:\nZan will help.\nTalia:\nI will help. I'm helping.\nOliver:\n\"See that? There? That's a tile on the floor.\"\nAlice:\nUh, all right, so 15 + 2 = 17.\nOliver:\nAwesome. Okay, Yeah. You take a good long look at this tile that's been pushed up slightly at one corner where you could see this, like, strange looking vine pushing against it. And you realize that if you take the sword and put it through at the pivot point that you've noticed you can easily pop this tile off.\nAlice:\nOkay, I will point this out to Zan. And kind of look up expectantly.\nZAN:\nOh, OK, let me...\nJASMIN:\nI-- I'd really rather no do it myself. I'd probably just hurt something.\nZAN:\nOh, sure. Let me give it a go. I will do that, with the sword that I have.\nOliver:\nWith that high of an investigation check you don't need a strength check. You stick the tip of the sword in the opening right where Jasmin points it out and give it a good old lever push and it pops right off. As Jasmin holds her ball of flame over the opening, you can see that this is some sort of maintenance shaft. There is a ladder that goes from the opening where you are, just, down into the darkness. And all curled around this ladder, reaching downwards.. or maybe reaching upwards... Are these vines, that on your first seeing of this weird plant Zan recognized as maybe some sort of rose bush thing. In the purple light that you have the plant looks -- as you would imagine -- purple. And there's a tunnel leading down.\nJASMIN:\nI think these plants are somehow magical? The last time we were in this room, I used, uh...\nAlice:\nJasmin opens up her menu and scrolls through it.\nJASMIN:\nI used this spell \"see magic\" and it was glowing.\nZAN:\nWell, we could check down there. Maybe it's sort of magic at its roots.\n{18:58}\nJASMIN:\nYeah, I was thinking maybe this was part of the outside world coming in. The robot said that there's this SPE everywhere and it's trying to protect us from it. Maybe this plant is like that, too? Like the SPE is what gives us magic. So maybe that's what makes the planet magic.\nZAN:\nHuh. I guess? I don't know.\nOliver:\nI'm picturing the meme with the lady with a bunch of math equations around her head for Zan right now.\nZAN:\nYeah. Yes, sure. Sure are... Yeah, that tracks.\nJASMIN:\nLet's see what's done there.\nTalia:\nZan moves to climb down the ladder.\nOliver:\nOkay, roll an acrobatics check.\nTalia:\nOh, boy.\nOliver:\nYou're just gonna straight just start climbing down, right?\nTalia:\nYeah. 15, fitting.\nOliver:\nOkay, great. You climb down carefully, making sure to avoid the thorns that are all along this long vine. Jasmin, are you going too?\nAlice:\nYeah. I'm trying to see if I have any way to make this safer for me. I definitely do not. I'm just going to try it!\nOliver:\nOkay. And you're still holding your handful of fire?\nAlice:\nNo, I am... I'm going to extinguish that.\nOliver:\nOkay. I'm also going to assume that Zan you put down your weapons in order to climb down this hole?\nTalia:\nYeah. Do I have any way of carrying these weapons or am I always assuming that they're in my hands?\nRobot:\nYeah. Did we ever figure out a way to unsummon them?\nOliver:\nYou did not.\nTalia:\nGreat.\nRobot:\nHmm.\nOliver:\nYou put them down on the floor and then you crawl in this dark hole with plant in it. Then Jasmin turns out her light and is also going to climb into the hole with you. So I need both of you to make an acrobatics check at disadvantage because it's pitch black.\nTalia:\nYay. Oh, man. Well, one of them was an 18, and the other one was a 4. So that sucks.\nOliver:\nSo, Zan. The light goes out and you keep climbing, and the climbing part is okay. You just slowly put one foot down under the other and so on. But you managed to scrape your arm right across one of those thorns. You take 1 damage and I need you to make a constitution saving throw.\nTalia:\nOh, boy. [Rolls.] That is a 16.\nOliver:\nOkay. You don't feel any ill effects from it other than your arm hurts and it's bleeding a little. Jasmin, what do you get for the acrobatics?\nAlice:\nI got a 6 - 1 = 5.\nOliver:\nOkay, great. You also kind of stumble your way down this hole and manage to just scrape up one of your arms pretty bad. Make a constitution saving throw.\nAlice:\n14 - 2 = 12.\nOliver:\nAll right. You are also fine.\nAlice:\nOkay.\nOliver:\nSo you climb this ladder for a while. You would guess it's on the scale of, like, 50 feet you go down.\nZAN:\nWell, it's a long ladder, huh?\nJASMIN:\nYeah. Uh.\nOliver:\nYou keep going?\nTalia:\nMade it this far.\nJASMIN:\nLet me know once you're down.\nZAN:\nYeah, I don't worry. Uh uh, Yeah, we'll be fine. It's a ladder.\nJASMIN:\nYeah.\nAlice:\nI will make the fire again once we're on the ground.\nOliver:\nOkay. Yeah. When you get to the bottom, you're standing in a small space. This entire, like, maintenance hatch, is maybe, like, three feet by three feet. And at the bottom, you find another hatch on the wall. It has a rusted metal handle.\nAlice:\nWhere is the where the plants coming from?\nOliver:\nThe plants have pushed through-- there's, like, a vent next to this, like exit hatch, and they are stuffed through this vent. They are coming into the maintenance shaft from the vent next to the exit hatch.\nTalia:\nCan we try the exit hatch?\nOliver:\nYeah. You just grab onto this rusted handle and pull it, and the door creaks open and you're in a large dark hallway.\nAlice:\nUm, I'd like to cast detect magic.\nOliver:\nOkay. So, Zan, you watch as Jasmin selects this detect magic spell of her menu and pinkish yellow energy just shoots out of her body, swirls up and into her eyes and her eyes are now glowing and giving off this kind of like faint yellow light. Jasmin, as you look around, you can see this path of vines is just lit right up. It pushes out of that vent and into this hallway and then leads off down to the end of the hallway where there is a set of double doors.\nAlice:\nI will follow them.\nTalia:\nAll right. I'll follow her.\nOliver:\nYou to walk quietly down this hallway. The only sounds you hear are the sounds of your footsteps echoing off the concrete. And when you get to these double doors, you see that the vines have pushed outwards from whatever's back there into this hallway. And you trace them down the hallway and they must have gone up through that vent trying to get up and out. Are you going to open the doors?\nTalia:\nYeah, we've made it this far.\nAlice:\nCome this far.\nOliver:\nAll right. Great.\n[DM Note: This is where I was panicking about the encounter I planned for this room, since I had meant for it to be against all 5 of them. Then I realized that with my magical DM powers I could make that encounter just not happen.]\nOliver:\nThe two of you have to work together because these doors are pretty rusted along the hinges, but you managed to creak them open. You walk through these doors into an enormous room. Your light doesn't reach the ceiling or the walls to either side. The majority of the room is pitch black. Close to you you can see these metal tables and benches and what looks like some sort of science equipment. You see beakers and tubes that are all crusted and rotting. Something further in the room is just a ball of light to you, Jasmin, and the vines lead straight up to it. You also see a shape that takes up... I don't know-- it's probably 30 feet high and 60 to 70 feet long. Further into the darkness, you see just a glowing skeleton. It's almost blinding, this glowing giant skeleton. Zan, you see a faint glow in the distance. You do not see it lit up like Jasmin does.\n[DM Note: This facility's aesthetic branches off from the videogame \"Portal\" here to more like the videogame \"Prey,\" both of which are very good games.]\nJASMIN:\nOkay. That wasn't what I was expecting.\nZAN:\nIs something glowing back there?\nJASMIN:\nIt's, uh, a very big skeleton.\nZAN:\nUh, like, like a big human skeleton? Or like like a big...\nAlice:\nOliver?\nOliver:\nUm, make a nature check. Jasmin.\nAlice:\nRight. Ha, I rolled very bad. 3 + 4.\nTalia:\nOh no!\nAlice:\nOkay. Um, could I, in any way, get advantage on it if I describe what I'm seeing?\nOliver:\nYou could go closer to it and get advantage.\nAlice:\nI'll do that.\nOliver:\nAs the two of you pick your way across the room-- Are you gonna pass by that where the vines lead, or you just gonna go around that, straight to the big skeleton?\nAlice:\nI mean, I want to investigate both of them, but the skeleton is what we're focused on.\nOliver:\nOkay, great. Well, the vines lead, like towards the center of the room. And so, as you're picking your way through this discarded science equipment, you're walking alongside the vines, and they make their way to this big glass tube. Similar to the one that you pulled Erica out of earlier. It is about five feet around, 15 feet high, and it's just filled with those vines. The glass is broken on one side and the vines are spilling out onto the floor, including the trail that you've been following. Inside you see bundles of thorns and leaves and a couple huge large purple flowers. Actually, everything looks purple to you because you have purple fire.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nYou realize this, as you look at Zan, and you go \"Wow, Zan's purple, too!\"\nJASMIN:\nOh, I never realized you were purple.\nZAN:\nOh, you're right. You don't say.\nTalia:\nUh, can I see the-- are we close enough that, like the fire is illuminating it for me as well?\nOliver:\nYes.\nTalia:\nNow that I've got, like, a better sense of the flowers, could I check to see if I recognize the plant better?\nOliver:\nYes. Making nature check with advantage.\nTalia:\nOh ho. 12.\nOliver:\nThis is is a weird, mutant version of a rose bush. You recognize the pattern of the way the petals shape, the shape of the leaves. The instinct to your brains screams alien, but as you look at it, you're like \"Rose alien?\". The flowers are about as big around as a dinner plate.\nZAN:\nHuh. These flowers makes me very nervous.\nJASMIN:\nUm, yeah, I kind of like-- I mean, I know that they're scary and magic, but they're also... life? We haven't seen any life other than us since we came here. It's kind of reassuring for me.\nZAN:\nDid you wanna take it with us?\nJASMIN:\nNo, it seems pretty happy here.\nZAN:\nOkay. Well, I'm glad you found something that is comforting in all this.\nJASMIN:\nI have a lot of plants at home. Had. I guess. Maybe that's why I'm a beardy man with magic now.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nGreat. You looked at the plant. Anything else you want to do?\nTalia:\nGood talk.\nAlice:\nYes. We want to look at the skeleton!\nTalia:\nTell us about the skeleton!\nOliver:\nOkay. Great. Yeah. You're like, \"OK, cool. Big plant. Now skeleton! Skeleton!\" You pick your way across this room, and as you approach this glowing shape – Zan you can now see it fairly clearly – to Jasmin, it is almost blinding to look at. But Zan, you see... bones. As you look up, you're reminded of the first time you saw a dinosaur skeleton as a child. The way it towered over you, stretching the limits of your imagination. This is that, but much bigger. This creature's bones are– actually, they look exactly like your weapons. They are slightly translucent and filled with this swirling pink and yellow and purple light. Although they are more dull than your weapons are. Then this huge shape is encased in a tank that takes up a giant section of the room, thick glass.\nAlice:\nGun tank? Or....?\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nIt-- no, uh, like an aquarium.\n[Laughter]\nAlice:\nI'm picturing this big Sherman tank with a skeleton in it.\nTalia:\nLike it was driving it and then suddenly died.\nOliver:\n–and then suddenly died. Underground.\nAlice:\nYes.\nOliver:\nWhere some horrible person propped it up in a sad mockery of its life.\nTalia:\nThat's much better. Change the campaign.\nOliver:\nI changed the campaign, alright, it's riding in a little tank.\nTalia:\nLook at how comically, oddly balanced this is. Why would it drive such a small tank? We may never know.\nAlice:\nThat is a regular sized tank for us, because it's big skeleton.\nTalia:\nUh huh.\nAlice:\nSo it's like a tank like the ones that we were in, but very large?\nOliver:\nYes.\nAlice:\nIs there a like any, like information placards or anything?\nOliver:\nUm, no, there aren't. This room-- as you've been walking through it --has seemed like weirdly empty. You'd expect to see, like, papers, or remnants of things, but all you found is things that are made of glass and metal.\nAlice:\nCan I do the second roll of my advantage?\nOliver:\nYes, I'll say, since the two of you are standing there together, the two of you can make a nature check. One each, if you want.\nTalia:\nGreat.\nAlice:\nThat's better.\nTalia:\nThat's a 16.\nOliver:\nThe shape... It's not bipedal. It's not standing up straight like human. All its bones are arranged together like they've been hooked together like a skeleton in a museum. The head... it looks carnivorous. You see rows of canines. You can't make out the shape of it. It looks too wide to match up with anything any animal that you can bring to mind. It's also just way too big, so your brain thinks dinosaur. It has six legs, though. Two pairs of the legs are clustered up near the head like shoulders. And then there's spine and a rib cage and then back legs, then two long tails that extend out from the end of the spine. That is as much as you could gather from it.\nZAN:\nShit.\nOliver:\nLet's check in with the crew on the beds! So popping back upstairs, we have three of our humans, just kind of chilling out for nap time. What are you guys up to?\nAlan:\nUh, Cody has kind of lifted himself up from his face down position, and is up on his elbows, and, uh, he quickly hits his wrist together, calls out Mage Hand, has it go down and pick up his binders and colored pencils up to the bed in front of them so he can pull it out and start just doodling in once he has all the stuff. He, uh, fist bumps the spectral hand and says,\nCODY:\nThanks, Helpo!\nAlan:\nAnd then casts it to the side and it fades away. Then he pulls out one of his cards from his pocket, kind of splays them out so he can look at them all and picks up one and hits \"Light.\" Lights it up instead of his jumpsuit. So he has a light on his notebook. He'll, you know, sit there. And he just started, uh, just start doodling.\nRobot:\nIt was the worst decision to give a small child magic because you are never getting out of that bed again.\nOliver:\nJust uses Mage Hand to go get his stuff.\nAlan:\nWas that Max talking? Or is that--\nRobot:\nNo, it's just me.\nAlan:\nOkay. Just didn't know if Cody needed to respond to Max.\nAllison:\nErica is trying to see if her phone even works.\nOliver:\nNo, it is dead. You... actually, make an investigation check.\nAllison:\nOh, baby, that's a four.\nOliver:\nNevermind. You look around the room for a plug. You're kind of like holding your charging cable. And you're like, \"No plugs don't exist.\"\nAllison:\nSick.\nOliver:\nYou put your charging cable away.\nAllison:\nPerfect.\nOliver:\nYeah. When you have you poked your phone, it doesn't even do the thing where it says, \"Low battery.\" Just kind of sits there.\nRobot:\nMax is like, dozing off in the bed.\nOliver:\nOkay, well. Now that we've caught up with these guys...\n[Laughter]\nAlice:\nSo we just realized that this was a weird big alien skeleton with six legs and two tails.\nOliver:\nYes.\nZAN:\nThis is a lot weirder than I thought it was gonna be.\nJASMIN:\nYeah, me too.\nZAN:\nI don't– I don't even know where to put this in my brain.\nJASMIN:\nHonestly, I spent these last... days? I don't even know if it's days. But I spent these last days scared that we were in the future. Like we were kidnapped and put in ice. And then the world went through an apocalypse, and now it's like 100 years later, and here we are or something. But maybe... we're on an alien planet or something now.\nZAN:\nOh.\nJASMIN:\nThat's obviously not a whale, or an elephant.\nZAN:\nYeah, okay, that's a fun new scenario. I was still in the time travel theory. Oh. God.\nJASMIN:\nCould be either, honestly. I mean, if there's if there's magic than I guess this could just be an elephant that was changed by magic.\nZAN:\nI feel like magic I could handle, right? Like it's-- It's like a known-- like we've all read at least some kind of fantasy novel or or TV show or something. But like, but like, what even is this like? I don't even know how to classify any of this. Now are they like hunting giant space monsters and then using them to make magic bracelets? Like what-- I don't-- jeez.\nOliver:\nAs the two of you are standing here, Jasmin your detect magic fades, and so now you are standing basically in the dark with your flame, and you can see that the skeleton is glowing slightly, but nothing else in the room is lit up anymore.\nTalia:\nYeah, before we leave, could we just do a quick perception check or investigation check on the the tube with all the plants?\nOliver:\nSure.\nTalia:\nBecause my thought is if it's like, a tube like what we were in, like... did these grow out of a person? Like--\nAlice:\nI thought of that too and I hate it.\n[DM Note: This is where I decided that yes, the plants did grow out of a person. Up until now they were just weird plants. Thanks Alice!]\nOliver:\nAll right. Yeah. You make your way back over to these plant. Make a... yeah, I'd say make an investigation check. And you can either both roll or one of you roll with advantage.\nTalia:\nUh, let's both roll. We can spread out the blame that way.\nAlice:\nInvestigation?\nOliver:\nYeah.\nAlice:\nAh, 18. (16 + 2.)\nTalia:\nOh, thank God. I got a 3. I can't find my own butt.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nYou turn around and Zan is actually looking at a desk very intently, and Jasmin, you're like, \"No, look over-- Look over here--\" and you crouch down and look in the side of the tube and hold up your flame very close so you can get a good look in, and you see some bones in there. And as you walk a little bit further around, you see... it looks like half of a human skull.\nJASMIN:\nUhhhh.\nRobot:\n[Gulp noise.]\nZAN:\nHuh. Funny. I thought there were flowers. This is just wood.\nOliver:\nZan's looking at a desk. She's lost.\nAlice:\nJasmin just kind of-- is there, like, dust on the ground?\nOliver:\nYes.\nAlice:\nJasmin, just kind of like, puts a hand on in the dust in front of it. And then closes her eyes for a second, then stands up, walks back to Zan.\nJASMIN:\nUm, I think I think we found everything we can find here.\nZAN:\nYou okay?\nJASMIN:\nI was hoping it was going to be an exit, but unless you want to see more bones...?\nZAN:\nNo, I-- I think I've seen enough bones for today.\nJASMIN:\nMe too.\nZAN:\nIt's, uh... let's go back.\nOliver:\nYou two make your way back to those double doors out into the hallway. And as you walk down the hallway in the other direction you find a metal door that opens into a stairwell that leads up, and it says, B5 on the wall there.\nJASMIN:\nOh, this actually looks a lot more practical of a way to get there than we took.\nZAN:\nYeah, that's way better than a spiky ladder.\nJASMIN:\nSo we... Yes.\nOliver:\nDid you take hat with you, Zan?\nTalia:\nDown the thing?\nOliver:\nYeah.\nTalia:\nI just, like, always assume that Hat is like in my purse, if I forget about that.\nOliver:\nGreat. Great. All right. She's in your purse. She feels great. Yeah, you to go upstairs and see that B4 is actually caved in. Like you peek through the window on the door and it's just piles of rubble.\nTalia:\nLike someone didn't wanna have to make up some more rooms.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nNo, it's weird. It's-- It's like you feel like it makes a ton of sense that it's caved in.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nYeah, B3 is also caved in, bitches.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nYou make it up to B2. You're like, \"All right, I remember that. I remember where the new lady got stabbed.\" You make it up to B1 and you're like \"It's our friends!\"\nTalia:\nWe've seen everything in this building! Let's go.\nAlice:\nUm, so I would like to ask Cody, while they were walking back, I want to ask Cody if Cody wants to learn a TikTok dance.\n[Laughter]\nAllison:\nBecause, like, I'm just trying to bond with this child. And I'm bored as hell. Um, because my phone's dead.\nERICA:\nSo Cody, do you-- Would you like to learn a TikTok dance?\nCODY:\nUm, I'm not a really good dancer, but, uh. Sure!\nERICA:\nIt's fine.\nAllison:\nSo as, um, Zan and Jasmin walked back in, I'm just, like--\nERICA:\n[Singing.] Spooky scary skeletons send shivers down your spine.\nAllison:\nAnd I'm trying to, like, teach it to to Cody so that that's what they enter back into.\nTalia:\nZan walks right back out into the hallway.\n[Laughter]\nAlan:\nI really need to roll to find out how good Cody is at picking this up.\nOliver:\nRoll a performance check.\nAlan:\nOkay. Oh, wow. That's a 17 + 3 = 20.\n[Laughter]\nAllison:\nOh wow.\nOliver:\nCody gets it immediately. The two of you are moving in sync like you've been practicing for years together. You move as one.\nAllison:\nI also want to know if Max is doing the TikTok dance with us.\nRobot:\nOh, no. Like, Max was dozing off. And then as soon as he heard the word TikTok, he didn't move, but he was 110% paying attention.\nOliver:\nSo is Max laying there in bed doing the dance?\nRobot:\nNo, he's just watching them. And fucking dying.\nOliver:\nGood.\nTalia:\nLike a good dying or bad dying?\nRobot:\nGood.\nTalia:\nOh, excellent.\nAlice:\nJasmin stares. Ah, kind of looks between them and between Zan, who walks off, and then once they're done, just goes [Excited clapping.]\n[Laughter]\nTalia:\nZan takes that as a cue that it's safe to re-enter.\nERICA:\nThank you very much.\nAllison:\nAnd Erica does a deep bow, and prompts Cody to also do the same.\nAlan:\nCody was already mimicking. Like, thought it was part of the dance. 100%.\nOliver:\nI'm gonna say that Erica, you now have a point of inspiration.\nAllison:\nHell, yeah.\nOliver:\nAnd I don't have anywhere to put that on your spreadsheet, but just put it somewhere. And then everyone who was there for this song and dance roll a D6. So not Zan/Talia.\nAlan:\nThat's a six.\nOliver:\nYou regain that many hitpoints.\nAlice:\nThree. How fun.\nRobot:\nI got back six.\nAllison:\nThat was my song of rest. A TikTok dance.\n[Laughter]\nAlan:\nOh, beautiful.\nAlice:\nJasmin will walk over to a table. Probably one of the tables that is, like, pushed to the side. And see if there's something that she could improvise as a plate.\nOliver:\nUm, make an investigation check.\nAlice:\nNatural. 20.\nOliver:\nDamn.\nAlice:\nPlus two. I find the best fucking plate.\nOliver:\nYou find just a beautiful metal dish. It is slightly curved. Kind of a kidney bean shape. It was hidden under some stuff. So you pull it out, it's got no dust on it. It's pristine. You love it.\n[DM Note: This is a real medical item.]\nAlice:\nOK, I will just brush it off for good measure and then go through my menu. I will cast Good Berry.\n[Laughter]\nRobot:\nUh...\nOliver:\nYou all see a little burst of the pinkish yellow magic from Jasmin. And Jasmin you now have 10 smooth, round, hot pink berries in your new metal dish.\nAlice:\nWhat does this look like? Do I create like, a plant that grows them and then the plant dies? Or what do they just appear?\nOliver:\nNo, similar to your other spells this energy emanates off of you and then pools and condenses into these berries. Make an arcana check.\nAlice:\n[Exaggerated] Arcaawna.\nOliver:\n[Mimicking] Arcaawna.\nTalia:\nMake an Arkam check.\nAlice:\nThat's a 2 + 2 = 4.\nOliver:\nYou don't know why they did that. \"Wow,\" you think. \"That was weird.\"\nAlice:\nI take the plate and I turn around and I say\nJASMIN:\nUh, I think I made dinner?\nCODY:\nWuh-- You could do this this whole time?\nJASMIN:\nI could do it now. I didn't know I could do it before.\nCODY:\nWait. What?\nJASMIN:\nThere's some new options in my menu.\nCODY:\nWhat you mean?\nAlan:\nCody hits his wrist things together and scrolls down, not realizing he could scroll down.\nJASMIN:\nCody. You should eat before you do you stuff.\nCODY:\nI have a new one. That's cool.\nZAN:\nWe would each eat like... two berries?\nJASMIN:\nWell, it says that one berry is enough nourishment for a day. Try one.\nZAN:\nOh... OK.\nOliver:\nYou're all pretty hungry.\nAllison:\nI eat one.\nTalia:\nI also eat one.\nRobot:\nMax is gonna walk over to Jasmin and be like\nMAX:\nSo-- Do you know, like, the macros or anything for these? Or... how many calories are in this?\nJASMIN:\nUh, one HP.\nMAX:\nWhatever. I'm hungry.\nAlan:\nCody just walks over and holds his hand out.\nOliver:\nOkay yeah, each of you that takes a berry. It's just this, like, hot pink little blueberry looking thing and pop it in your mouth. Give it a chew. It tastes pretty good, actually. Really good. It reminds you of that dish that you had when you were young. You can't remember what it was, but you're all healed for one hit point and no longer hungry. You feel satiated.\nTalia:\nSurprise, it's a star drop.\n[DM Note: Silly Talia, that's not what star drops from Stardew Valley do! Star drops raise your max hit points. These berries just heal you. Get dunked on.]\nAlice:\nI give, um, Cody two of them. Just put an extra one in his hand.\nCODY:\n[Gasps.]\nJASMIN:\nYou need to grow.\nAlan:\nHe goes and puts the other in his backpack.\n[Laughter]\nAlan:\nHe only wants to eat one. One was satiating for a day, so he's not hungry anymore.\nOliver:\nDid he just put a loose berry in his backpack?\nAlan:\nHave you met a 12 year old?\nRobot:\nYeah. You know, kid shit.\nOliver:\nSure, great. We'll resolve that later.\n[Laughter]\nAlice:\nAnd then Jasmin takes another one and walks over to Zan and says--\nJASMIN:\nFor Hat?\nZAN:\nOh, rad. Thanks. Uh, I don't know how much one of these is good for, like, a human. What's good for a rat?\nJASMIN:\nThe rat probably knows.\nZAN:\nThat's fair. Oh, Erica, you're good with rats, right?\nERICA:\nUh, what?\nZAN:\nYou're not, like, freaked out by rats?\nERICA:\nOh, yeah. No, that's fine.\nZAN:\nAwesome.\nCODY:\nShe's got a rat.\nERICA:\nI thought you were asking me if I was, like, some kind of rat veterinarian.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nI also thought that! I was like, scrolling through her backstory like, did I miss this?\nJASMIN:\nAre you a rat veterinarian?\nERICA:\nDefinitely not. But like, yeah, rats are cool. They're chill.\nRobot:\nTurns out Erica's the Pied Piper.\nZAN:\nThis is Hat. She's a rat. I'm gonna feed her this berry now.\nOliver:\nAll right. Yes. She takes it in her tiny little hands and she nibbles on it. She eats about half of it, and then she curls back up and goes to sleep, and she looks very content while she's out.\nAlice:\nCan I... scan her?\n[Laughter]\nTalia:\nFor what??\nOliver:\nAre you sleight-of-handing this? Or are you just gonna stand there and lift up your wrists and scan?\nAlice:\nYeah.\nOliver:\nAll right, Zan, as you're feeding Hat the berry, Jasmin is still kind of looming over you, and she taps her, wristbands together, pushes a button, and out of her wristband comes this. I don't know. Sci-fi scanner beam of light that kind of goes [bzz bzz]. And scans your rat. And Jasmin, your SPEL lets out a little chime, and you now have -- under your wild shape database -- a 3D rendering of a rat.\nZAN:\nWhat?\nMAX:\nOh, my God.\nZAN:\nWhat? Ah-- did you just-- is my rat okay?\nJASMIN:\nI think it made a.... I think it made a like a sculpture of your rat. Look, look.\nZAN:\nThat's... great.\nERICA:\nWe can like, 3D print a rat?\nJASMIN:\nIt says wild shape. So maybe I can make a rat? I don't know.\nERICA:\nThat's... neat.\nZAN:\nWhy would you want to make a rat?\nJASMIN:\nBecause then there will be two rats.\nZAN:\nBut is it like a new sentient rat?\nJASMIN:\nI don't know. I just says wild shape and it says I can't do it today, so we'll see tomorrow.\nCODY:\nMe next. Me next! Do me, do me! Scan me!\nJASMIN:\nIt also says I can only scan one creature per day, so I probably can't do you, Cody?\nCODY:\nOh, maybe tomorrow maybe.\nJASMIN:\nUh, I don't know if you're a creature.\nCODY:\nMy mom calls me a wild animal when I'm hyper.\n[Laughter]\nCODY:\nOnly sometimes.\nJASMIN:\nI'm just going to put the rest of these berries in my bag, and maybe we can eat them tomorrow when we're hungry or something.\nOliver:\nGreat. With your very good investigation check you found a little pill bottle that's empty that you could put the berries in to keep them safe.\nAlice:\nCool. Will do. Did I find anything else?\nOliver:\nNo. You found two cool things, that's all.\nAlice:\nOK, good to know.\nOliver:\nThis room sucks!\nAlice:\nJust, because– I remember that last time we were here you were very sad that we all sucked so bad at investigating.\nTalia:\nNo, But then I did a good one. I did a good check, and I found absolutely nothing. It's all garbage.\nAlice:\nTrue.\nOliver:\nTrue, this is old stinky garbage.\nTalia:\nIt's garbage from a garbage can.\nAlice:\nThen she'll just sit on one of the beds and look through her stuff and be sad that there is no power to charge her 3DS.\nOliver:\nAll right, would you all like to take a short rest here and just hang out for, like, an hour?\nAlice:\nI think that makes sense.\nAllison:\nYeah, sure.\nOliver:\nWe could say that Jasmin and Zan fill you in on what they saw in the basements.\nZAN:\nGiant fucking skeleton!! ...friggin' skeleton!\nJASMIN:\nMaybe we should– wait-- maybe we shouldn't tell Cody about that.\nZAN:\nWhy not?\nOliver:\nShe already did.\nZAN:\nToo late.\nCODY:\nThat sounds cool.\nMAX:\nDid you, like, bring any of it back?\nJASMIN:\nNo, but it had two tails and six legs.\nERICA:\nMax, are you some kind of bone collector? What's going on?\nMAX:\nLook, you're telling me if you found a bunch of bones you wouldn't like, take some?\nZAN:\nYeah, that's exactly what we're telling you.\nERICA:\nYeah!\nJASMIN:\nI think you might have some already. Anyway.\nAlan:\nCody taps Jasmin as close to her shoulder as he can get, which is not very close, but he tries.\nRobot:\nLike her hip?\nAlan:\nPretty much.\nJASMIN:\nYes?\nCODY:\nUm, did you find Wrenchie?\nZAN:\n[Gasps.] We forgot to look for Wrenchie!\nJASMIN:\nI... Yeah, we kind of forgot to look for Wrenchie.\nCODY:\nOkay. Maybe some other time. When we come back.\nJASMIN:\nWe did find a rose bush, though.\nZAN:\nYeah, a big alien rose bush with possibly purple flowers.\nJASMIN:\nEverything kind of looked purple.\nZAN:\nYeah, it's weird how everything down there was purple. Maybe that was just the purple floor.\nJASMIN:\nYeah, but I think we I think we all have a part of the skeleton already, anyway.\nZAN:\nUh, like inside us? Like the real skeleton was in us all along?\nJASMIN:\nYes. And it's covered with blood!\n[Laughter]\nJASMIN:\nNo, no.\nOliver:\nYou solved my skeleton puzzle!\nAlan:\nCody is just looking at his hands.\n[Laughter]\nRobot:\nYou just gave Cody an existential crisis.\nJASMIN:\nNo, I mean-- the skeleton looked like our weapons do. Like it was glowing and kind of weirdly ethereal and stuff. So maybe it's the weapons are made out of skeleton. They used to make knives out of bone a very long time ago.\nZAN:\nRad.\nCODY:\nSo you're saying I have a big staff bone?\nJASMIN:\nA big what?\nCODY:\nA staff bone. My big staff. It's made of bone?\nZAN:\nYeah, you're like a cubone.\nERICA:\n[Singing.] The staff bone's connected to the bow bone.\n[Laughter]\nTalia:\nWas that a bard song?\nAllison:\nIt sure was. I guess every song I sing now is a bard song.\nTalia:\nIt's beautiful.\nAlice:\nErica spends this short rest making a whole song about staff bones.\nRobot:\nCan you accomplish a task during a short rest, or do you only just rest?\nOliver:\nYou could only just, like, eat and hang out. You don't actually need to take a short rest if you don't want. If your character doesn't want to.\nRobot:\nBecause I don't really need to...\nOliver:\nYou wanna like, do some squats?\nRobot:\nAh, what I want to do is...\nOliver:\n–take a poop?\nRobot:\nUh, try to find something in the room that I can use to make a sling so that I can hang the shield on my back and put the sword on my hip.\nOliver:\nOh, sure, Yeah. Make an investigation check.\nAllison:\nCraft check!\nOliver:\nMake a craft check! It's craft time!\nRobot:\n[Rolls.] Welp.\nOliver:\nThis is like a kindergarten classroom. We're learning songs, we're doing crafts--\nTalia:\nThere's dancing.\nRobot:\nThat's, ah, 4 - 1.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nMax gets up from the bed and goes and he spends about, you know, half an hour kind of sorting through all of this medical equipment. And about half an hour in he's like, \"Oh, yes, maybe--\" Max, you take one point of damage. You just stabbed yourself with an old needle.\nRobot:\nCool.\nOliver:\nMake a constitution saving throw. [Yelling.] I'm tired of being in this room!\nRobot:\n12 + 2 = 14.\nOliver:\nYou're fine. But next time you won't be fine. You feel it in your bones. In your staff bone.\nAlice:\nWhat's the DC for tetanus??\nOliver:\nI don't know. It's pretty old.\nERICA:\nAll right.\nZAN:\nCan we please leave? I'm bored.\nCODY:\nOkay!\nERICA:\nLet's go.\n{54:11}\n===== START MIDROLL ====\nAlan:\nWelcome to Dice Disasters. This is part of the episode where we stop pretending to be other people and start pretending to be ourselves. With me, I got Oliver today. Hey, Oliver.\nOliver:\nHi!\nAlan:\nWe're here in the middle of episode five. Oliver, I have discovered some of my favorite people in the world.\nOliver:\nYou have?\nAlan:\nI have. It's the people who have listened to all of our first 5 episodes that we put on at once, on the Internet. And people listened to it. And if they're hearing us now it means they've made it through most of the first 5 and I'm very happy.\nOliver:\nThat's a lot of shenanigans.\nAlan:\nIt really is a lot of shenanigans. They have met and lost Wrenchie. They have seen all of us do stupid things like run into electric fences.\nOliver:\nHonestly, just running into danger over and over again.\nAlan:\nYeah, just for no reason.\nOliver:\nFor no reason.\nAlan:\nBut we did make a new friend in Erica! Glad to have her, and Allison has joined us.\nOliver:\nMe too.\nAlan:\nBut thank you for listening to our podcast. We have a couple quick announcements before we get back to the story that you all are enjoying. First off, we've leveled up. Oliver, do you want to tell everyone quickly about our level up?\nOliver:\nYeah! So, the level up in the episode happens a little quietly, I think just because everyone was so overwhelmed with all of the fighting and discovering of a new person in a tube and all of that. But yeah, everyone is now level 2. And for a lot of the characters that means there's some new stuff for them in their spell casting menus. If you are interested in looking at our character sheets in more detail for the five main characters, you can find those on our website.\nAlan:\nSpeaking of websites, we have a really cool one, designed by Allison, who plays Erica. It's dicedisasters.com. So go there, get all the kind of crazy nerd stuff about our podcast. You can follow us on Twitter, we're @dicedisasters. We'd love to hear from you if you are excited about the show.\nOliver:\nYeah, honestly, I am so nervous about the idea of somebody actually listening to this.\nAlan:\nI know. It's like... this is like-- this is Episode five? We're launching all these at once. Like, we just know that this is out in the world and people are hearing it and they actually might talk to us about it? If they like it? And it's like, that's-- That's the wildest stuff I've ever thought of.\nOliver:\nLike honestly, if, like, five people like this, I will be just over the moon excited. And I'm already like I'm, like, shaking now thinking of, yeah, people actually listening.\nAlan:\nYeah.\nOliver:\nMaybe we can just record all of these and then put them on a Google drive and then just not release them.\nAlan:\nUm, I don't think that's the plan, Oliver. I think if they're listening to this they actually already know that isn't the plan. We did it.\nOliver:\nYeah.\nAlan:\nIf you are one of those people, those first 5 people that we love so much and you have enjoyed the show, please leave a review on whatever podcasting service you're using and let the world know. That will help us get shared to the world. Go on social media used the hashtag #dicedisasters. And if you do either of those, there's a chance that Oliver here might name an NPC after you and you can join our story in spirit.\nOliver:\nYes, I am very hungry for new names for my NPCs, so I don't have to just make them up on the spot as you guys decide to talk to random people.\nAlan:\nYeah. As we said in episode one, if you hear a Craigory you know what went wrong.\nOliver:\nYes. Oh, also, at some point, our beautiful players will be able to buy things with some sort of currency. And I would absolutely love it if people would give me ideas for items. We have an item submission form on our website. So if you go to dicedisasters.com and click on \"Item Submissions\" you can give us your wildest dreams, and I may or may not include it as something they can actually buy.\nAlan:\nYou do realize you're gonna actually get people's wildest dreams now and it's gonna be an experience for you.\nOliver:\nYes, I want them.\nAlan:\nI can't wait.\nOliver:\nGive me your nasty dreams.\nAlan:\nThat'll be so much fun. Well, this is kind of wrapping up the the middle part of our episode. We do want to say that now that we've got the first 5 out of the way we are going to release every other week on Wednesdays, so next one will come out two weeks from the day this was posted. We really love it that you've made it this far, and we can't wait to give you more. So let's get back to the story.\nOliver:\nHere's more... Dungeons and Dragons!\nAlan:\nWoohoo!\n=== END MIDROLL ===\nOliver:\nYou're are all packed and ready to go. Where you goin'?\nTalia:\nElevator!\nOliver:\nAll right, you all make your way down the hallway to what looks like some sort of big service elevator door. Actually, standing there next to it is the humanoid automaton and the light's off. It's just standing there, stoic, in the dark. You remember that you dragged it over there to check if it would open that airlock door. And it did not. Yeah, you kind of like cautiously peek down the elevator shaft? I'm guessing? Who feels brave and wants to take a peek?\nTalia:\nZan will!\nOliver:\nAlright, Zan goes over. Looks in there. Zan has nothing to make any sort of light.\nTalia:\nNope.\nOliver:\nIt's dark. She comes back.\nAlice:\nThrow a fireball down?\nOliver:\nYeah, all right. Jasmin, do you throw your fireball in it?\nTalia:\nAnd it explodes and we all die!\nOliver:\nNo, I'm picturing Zan goes back over and looks in and from, like, 15 feet back, Jasmin just hucks a fireball in there. And as it goes by, you see that there is a ladder just inside the elevator shaft–\nZAN:\nShit!\nOliver:\n--along one wall that leads upwards.\nCODY:\nHow about we just jump?\nZAN:\nDown? The elevator shaft?\nAlan:\nCody pulls out a card from his pocket and looks at it says,\nCODY:\nYeah, we can jump. I'll get us down.\nZAN:\nN-- no. What?\nJASMIN:\nBut we want to go up.\nZAN:\nYeah. What?\nCODY:\nWe want to go up?\nJASMIN:\nYeah.\nCODY:\nI thought we wanted to go down to B5.\nZAN:\nNo, we did B5.\nJASMIN:\nWe want to go up.\nCODY:\nWell, I didn't.\nZAN:\nYeah, but like, we told you all the stuff that was down there. There was big bones and big plant thing.\nCODY:\n[Dejected.] Okay.\nZAN:\nIt's all purple.\nERICA:\n[Singing] The big bone's connected to the plant bone.\n[Laughter]\nCODY:\nWrenchie's still down there.\nTalia:\nI start climbing the ladder.\nOliver:\nGreat, Zan just jumps in the elevator and starts climbing.\nTalia:\nI'm leaving this conversation and I'm climbing this ladder.\nOliver:\nIt's a solid ladder. I'm not gonna make you do a check. You can just climb up.\nTalia:\nNice.\nOliver:\nAnybody else going with her?\nAlice:\nI'm going.\nAllison:\nI'll go too.\nOliver:\nThe girls are in the elevator.\nRobot:\nUh, I'm gonna push Cody in front of me.\nTalia:\nWh-- WHAT??\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\n[Laughing, terrified] Did you just push him down the shaft??\nTalia:\nDon't push the boy down!!\nRobot:\nI don't want Cody to be last!\nAllison:\nMax murders Cody.\nAlice:\nJust murdered the child.\nOliver:\nYou guys get to the top. He's like, \"I don't know where-- I know where he went.\"\nRobot:\n\"I don't know!\"\nOliver:\n[Mocking] \"Went down!\"\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nDoes Cody climb up the elevator?\nAlan:\nYeah Cody climbs up.\nOliver:\nYou also start climbing up there. It's a solid ladder. You climb up what feels like maybe like 30 feet? Like, a decent way. Before you reach a door at the top of this elevator shaft you find another elevator door. It's shut. And as you get closer, you can see that it is like... melted shut. It looks like somebody took a welding torch and shut this thing in a hurry. Its bubbled and disfigured and solidly melted closed. But at the top of your ladder you reach a small metal hatch with a rusted handle and Zan, you recognize this as this as the type of hatch door that you went through when you climbed down to the basement.\nOliver:\nYou gonna open it?\nTalia:\nYes.\nOliver:\nAs you turn the handle, the hatch swings away from you revealing a small tunnel. The tunnel is straight for about 15 feet and then turns sharply to the left. And, beautifully, down there at the end of that turn, you can see some light trickling in. The tunnel's about three feet by three feet. The walls, floor and ceiling of the tunnel are blanketed with a dark, spongy substance.\nTalia:\nQuick nature check on the spongy substance.\nOliver:\nZan says, \"Hold up. Nature Check.\" Roll a nature check.\nTalia:\nThat's a nine.\nOliver:\nUh, you have advantage on plants cause you used to be a florist.\nTalia:\nYeah, but I-- like, that was like a day shift. I don't think I should get that much advantage.\nOliver:\nAll right, fine. It's dark and spongy.\nTalia:\nNice.\nZAN:\nAlright! It's nice and soft.\nOliver:\nYou poke it. It's fine.\nZAN:\nYeah. All right. Let's go.\nTalia:\nShe heads towards the sun.\nOliver:\nShe climbs into this tunnel. At that turn, you see another shaft leading downwards and curling up around the ladder of that shaft are thick, greenish purple vines covered in thorns. So you're guessing maybe that's a tunnel back down to rose plant land.\nAlice:\nRose plant land.\nOliver:\nBut in front of you, the tunnel opens up into blinding sunshine. You hear the lilting songs of birds and the gentle patter of rainfall. Tired, dirty and sore. You drag your bodies down the last few feet of this tunnel. It ends abruptly. The maintenance hatch at this end lies discarded on the ground, barely recognizable, covered in a thick blanket of this same squishy dark stuff which – you can see in the daylight – is moss.\nTalia:\nOh nice.\nOliver:\nAs you pull yourselves out of the tunnel you blink and hold your arms up to shield your eyes as they get used to the onslut-- onslaught...\n[Laughter]\nAlice:\nWHAT?\nOliver:\n[Quietly] You get used to that sweet slutty sunlight.\nAlan:\nIs this that the new version of OnStar? like you just press the button OnSlut?\nAllison:\n[Singing] Hey now, you're an onslut, get your game, go play!\nOliver:\nDo you all climb through the tunnel and go outside?\n[Laughter]\nTalia:\n[Dying with laughter] Yes!\nAlice:\nWe all see and feel the on slut.\n[Laughter]\nTalia:\nOh, god.\nOliver:\nYou're outside and you all take a big deep breath once you get out there and you realize that this air feels thick and rich and hardy compared to the recycled air you've been breathing in this basement. The sunlight warms your cold, tired bodies.\nTalia:\nAnd our cold dead hearts.\nAlan:\nYeah, Cody is kind of running in circles around the group, just kind of--\nCODY:\nWoohoo! We did it!! Woohoo! We're out!\nOliver:\nAs your eyes adjust to the sunlight, you realize you are in a strange place.\nTalia:\nAwww.\nOliver:\nEverything around you is coated in plant life. You're in a small clearing and what feels like the vague shape of a ruined building looms behind you. The walls, the ground, old support pillars, are just coated in moss and grass and weeds, and every shade of green. Flowers burst across every surface with intense shades of purples, reds and yellows. Beyond this structure, with this elevator shaft that is sealed shut from the inside and this strange little maintenance tunnel-- those are all the things you see left, really, poking out from the ground. Beyond the structure is a forest that towers above the trees are intertwined into a tangled mess of branches, and they're teaming with life. A flock of colorful birds bursts from the roosting place above you and dives into the forest with a cacophony of screeching and flapping. You see small creatures that dance in and out of view as they scurry around the underbrush, too fast for you to recognize. You are outside. What do you do?\nAlan:\nCody stops running around. Takes a deep breath after he tired himself out, skipping. He looks around and is like,\nCODY:\nUh, where are we?\nJASMIN:\nI don't know, but I'm very glad to not be underground anymore.\nTalia:\nCan we look around to see if there's, like, any landmarks other than like forest?\nOliver:\nSure. Make a perception check.\nJASMIN:\nOkay.\nTalia:\nYou can roll a perception check at advantage for the group.\nAlice:\nYeah.\nTalia:\nOkay, that's a 10.\nOliver:\nYeah, behind you where you came out of this maintenance shaft there's some like rectangular shapes that are covered in moss and stuff. And you're guessing these were buildings of some sort. They are in ruins. There are no complete buildings, just kind of like walls that stick up here and there. On the wall right beside the maintenance shaft, where you crawled out, though, there is a scrap of fabric. It's kind of like, tinted green, and it is tied around some sort of branch sticking out of the wall.\nTalia:\nWe look at... the fabric.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nI don't know when to just be like, \"you do the thing!\"\nAlan:\nAre there any, like, large rocks or boulders around?\nOliver:\nYes. Plenty.\nAlan:\nCody's gonna go behind one of those so that the group can't see him for a second.\nOliver:\nAll right. The child runs off and hides behind a boulder.\nAlan:\nWhile they're not paying attention.\nZAN:\nShit, where'd the kid go?\nOliver:\nRoll a stealth check.\nAlan:\nOkay. He's changing his clothes.\nAllison:\nOh, I was like [clapping] let Cody take a piss!\nAlan:\nHe might do that, too, but, uh, 7.\nOliver:\nYou all see Cody run over, he stands halfway behind a boulder and starts taking off his clothes. I imagine most of you avert your gazes.\nRobot:\nUh huh.\nAlice:\nYes.\nOliver:\nHe thinks he is very hidden.\nAlice:\nUm, is there any way to figure out, like, how old this fabric is? Or like, how long ago the buildings were ruined? Based on stuff? Oliver?\nOliver:\nMake an investigation check.\nAlice:\nAll right. 6 + 4 = 10.\nOliver:\nA long time ago. This is not the scale of, like, a couple of years for the buildings. Like, they look just completely worn back down into the environment. They are one with the ground. And it's only because you know what buildings look like that you're able to, like, discern that these are weirdly rectangular shapes sticking out of the underbrush.\nJASMIN:\nOne more point for the time travel theory, Zan.\nZAN:\nYeah. I'm not loving this.\nOliver:\nThe scrap of fabric is much newer, though. On the scale of months.\nRobot:\nCan I tell what the wall is made of, like, is it concrete? Brick?\nOliver:\nYeah. Concrete. You can see patches of it, actually, like around where this fabric is tied off. There is, like, a little bit of the concrete showing, and yeah, make an investigation check.\nRobot:\nGreat. My specialty.\nAlice:\nCan I help since I was looking into the building anyway?\nOliver:\nGo for it. You can each make one, or Max can have advantage.\nRobot:\nYou also make one because...\nAlice:\nAll right.\nRobot:\n...Max is kind of dumb.\nOliver:\nMax turns to Jasmin says \"Help. Wall?\"\nRobot:\nCause I got a 4 - 1 = 3.\nAlice:\nJasmin got a 14.\nOliver:\nMax. That's a big-- That's a big flat thing. Weird, huh?\nRobot:\nUh huh, weird.\nOliver:\nJasmin. You see Max looking at this-- What you recognize as a wall-- made of concrete, and you're looking at this wall and it's marked off by this piece of fabric tied around what you realize -- after scraping some of the moss back -- is like an old rusted pipe. It's just sticking out of the wall. And you get the sense that this new layer of moss is growing over a place that was exposed on the wall. As you check it out, you can kind of see what looks like writing underneath it.\nAlice:\nI'll scrape it off.\nOliver:\nYeah, OK, I'll say Max helps you out once you point out a thing for him to do with his two arms.\n[Laughter]\nAlice:\nWith his two arms that he possesses and can move.\nOliver:\nYes, So you scrape the moss off the wall-- it comes off fairly easily. It comes off in like these thick, soft clumps and underneath there is a message that looks like someone used, like, a rock to scratch the message into the wall. It says,\nTEXT:\nHead south. Follow the cloth.\nOliver:\nSo it was written some time ago, and this moss grew over it.\nTalia:\nAnd so it was written, and so it shall be.\nOliver:\nSo shall ye follow the cloth.\nAlan:\nCody walks back up wearing now, wearing his T-shirt and red hoodie and jeans. His standard boy attire. And is like,\nCODY:\nWhat's that?\nJASMIN:\nWell, it looks like someone got out before us.\nMAX:\nAnd they wrote on this, like, weirdly flat vertical cliff.\n[Laughter]\nJASMIN:\n[Whispering] It's concrete, Max.\nMAX:\nWhat?\n[Laughter]\nJASMIN:\nIt's concrete.\nMAX:\nBut--\nJASMIN:\nI mean, I understand why you're confused. I mean, it's obviously, like, 400 years old, and they didn't have concrete in the 1600s, but... it's concrete.\nMAX:\nUh, I'll take your word for it. I'm not-- I'm not a rock man, myself. Don't know much about those rocks.\nOliver:\n\"I'm an ass man!\"\n[Laughter]\nERICA:\nWell, should we, uh, should we follow it?\nJASMIN:\nThis is the only sign of life we've had. So why not? And they obviously want to help.\nCODY:\nAren't we supposed to find that voice's sister?\nERICA:\nYes.\nJASMIN:\nDo you... Well, I mean, I know I kind of defended the voice, but also, they did kind of experiment on us and possibly kill us and revive as magic people.\nZAN:\nYeah. Listen, I'd rather follow the signs of another Probably-Human in the same boat as we are than trust the weird entity that is probably gonna trap us and betray us.\nERICA:\nAlso, all we have to go on from that voice is coordinates. And we have no idea what coordinates were at now. So we might as well try to follow someone? And kind of figure out where we're at.\nJASMIN:\nThat's a good idea.\nZAN:\nIt's as good idea as any.\nJASMIN:\nI just need to do one thing before we can leave. Cody.\nCODY:\nMmhmm?\nJASMIN:\nCan I have the jumpsuit you just took off for a second?\nCODY:\nAh, yeah.\nAlan:\nAnd he hands it over.\nAlice:\nOkay. Jasmin will just kind of kneel before Cody and take the jumpsuit and say,\nJASMIN:\nYou have superpowers now so you need this.\nAlice:\nShe's going to take the, like, sleeves of the jump suit and tie them around Cody's neck them and have it hang like a cape.\nCODY:\nOh!! Wait-- just one second.\nAlice:\nCasts light on the jumpsuit.\n[Laughter]\nCODY:\nYes!\nAlan:\nHe just stands there with his hands on his hips in the stance that you gotta make and then stand there for a second waiting. And is like,\nCODY:\n[Quietly] I really wish there was wind right now.\nAlice:\n[Gasps.] I cast goost.\n[Laughter]\nAlan:\nCody has never been happier. Since you all have met him.\nOliver:\nSpecial effects magician Jasmin casts \"gust\" and Cody's beautiful, brilliant cape is flapping in the wind. He looks majestic.\nAlan:\nWith a sudden burst of confidence, Cody says--\nCODY:\nLet's go!\nAlan:\nAnd just takes off in what direction he thinks is South.\nRobot:\nOh no.\nOliver:\nOkay, Cody make a nature check. No-- Make a survival check.\nAlan:\nOkay. That's a 17.\nRobot:\nWow! Okay!\nOliver:\nAll right. Cody takes off into the forest, and as you all-- I assume -- watch him run off, you see him pass under a tree branch and as he runs by it flutters in the wind, and you see a scrap of gray fabric is tied around that tree branch.\nZAN:\nHey! Don't run off!\nJASMIN:\nWe should follow.\nZAN:\nWe should follow. He's gonna trip and fall.\nJASMIN:\nHe's very easy to follow with the glowing cape.\nOliver:\nSo the five of you start walking through the brush. Very quickly, once you kind of get into, like, the tangle of bushes and trees and there's no discernible path, you all end up clumped closer together. Cody, it's pretty hard to run through this forest. Your cape keeps getting stuck on things. Zan, You feel like you've been here before. You can't pick out any specific place that this reminds you of, but it feels familiar. You realize as you're walking that your mind is drifting and you are easily slipping between branches and over fallen trees and pushing thorny bushes out of the way so your fellow party members can follow you. Yeah, Zan, just naturally, your clump moves around until Zan is at the front, and she is leading to you through the brush. Every, I'd say like 30 feet or so, you find another scrap of fabric. It's difficult, but consistently Zan is pointing them out. You keep walking.\nAlan:\nCody goes up to Jasmin.\nCODY:\nHey, um, thanks for the cape. This was a good idea.\nJASMIN:\nYou're welcome. I mean, you have superpowers!\nCODY:\nI do have superpowers. I have a new one that I haven't tried yet, but... I don't want to try it, cause I think it might be a little... big. I'll wait.\nJASMIN:\nBesides, if you can keep it a secret, it'll be more impressive when you reveal it.\nCODY:\nThat's a good idea. You're smart.\nJASMIN:\nThank you. You're very smart yourself. Very brave.\nCODY:\nThanks. Did you see me do the dance with Erica?\nJASMIN:\nI did.\nCODY:\nOh, good. I'm gonna do it again later.\nJASMIN:\nThat's amazing. I can't dance at all.\nCODY:\nI didn't think I could, but Erica helped. Maybe Erica could give you a lesson.\nJASMIN:\nIf Erica could teach *me* to dance she'd be very impressive.\nCODY:\nErica! Jasmin wants to learn how to dance!\nJASMIN:\nOh! I don't-- No I don't!\nERICA:\nOh, I mean, I only know meme dances. That's what I do with my cousin Paige. We make TikToks, but, I mean, I can-- I can try. Somehow Cody's way better at it than me. It must be his little agile body. But we could learn some more dances.\nJASMIN:\nI really don't want to learn how to dance.\nERICA:\nThat's fine.\nCODY:\nMy sister, my sister tells me I'm made for memes. I don't know what that means.\nJASMIN:\nYou don't know what it memes?\nCODY:\n[Snort laughing.] You're funny.\nZAN:\nHow old's your sister?\nCODY:\nUh, she's-- She's seven years older than me. She's-- She's away at college.\nJASMIN:\nWhere does she go to college?\nCODY:\nUm, she's pretty far away. She's over in, um, Louisville? Louisville. She goes to school over... over in Louisville.\nJASMIN:\nRight, I know exactly where Louisville is.\nCODY:\nIt's--- It's far enough away that she doesn't get to come home often. I miss her a lot. She's the coolest.\nERICA:\nWhat's her name, Cody?\nCODY:\nWell, uh, everyone calls her-- Her name is Jessica. I call her Jex.\nZAN:\nIt's a cool name.\nJASMIN:\nThat's a really cool nickname.\nCODY:\nYeah, uh, when I was lots little, like, really little, I couldn't say Jessica. I kept saying Jexica by accident, so we just shortened that for me.\nJASMIN:\nYou know, my name isn't actually technically Jasmin.\nCODY:\nIt isn't?\nJASMIN:\nWell, it is, but it's not pronounced that way.\nCODY:\nOh! How are you supposed to say it?\nJASMIN:\nYawz-meen.\nCODY:\nYawz-meen?\nJASMIN:\nYeah.\nCODY:\nDo you want-- you want me to try to call you Yasmin?\nJASMIN:\nThat's okay. Jasmin is easier.\nCODY:\nOh, okay. Whatever you want.\nERICA:\nTo be honest, nobody can pronounce my last name. So that's a real mood.\nJASMIN:\nWhat's your last name?\nERICA:\nIt's Saint-Saëns [Pronounced kinda like SAIN-sawns, in a French way]. It's French.\nJASMIN:\nSaint-Saëns? [Pronounces it perfectly.]\nERICA:\n[Surprised] Yeah! You got it.\nZAN:\nLike the composer?\nERICA:\nYeah. Just like that. No relation. Not that cool, but there you go.\nCODY:\nI saw your name on the little screen when you were-- when we first woke you up, and I'm like, I can't even spell that, much less pronounce it. Can I just... call you Erica?\nERICA:\nYep, you can call me Erica. Most of my teachers called me Erica S.\nJASMIN:\nIt's really not that hard.\nERICA:\nYou haven't met enough Americans.\nJASMIN:\nI've... I've met, a lot of, um, in recent times...\nAlice:\nShe gestures at everyone else.\nCODY:\nErica, you taught me how to dance. Maybe you can help teach me how to say your name. I'd like that.\nERICA:\nSure, we can work on it.\nCODY:\nThanks.\nMAX:\nMy name's not actually Max. Well, it sort of is.\nCODY:\n[Yelling] Does anybody have a real name here?\nZAN:\nNo.\nMAX:\nLook, my parents actually-- my full name is Henry Maxwell Bernard Orland. But that sounds like...\n[Laughter]\nZAN:\nSounds's like an idiot's name.\nMAX:\nReally. Yeah, I don't want to be Henry, so I just get all my friends to call me Max.\nJASMIN:\nAre you like, royalty?\nAlan:\nCody starts bowing.\nMAX:\nWell, no... no, I wouldn't say that. Like...\nZAN:\nThat's exactly what someone who is royalty would say.\nOliver:\nThe least committal \"I'm not royalty\" that anyone ever said.\n[Laughter]\nZAN:\nLike either you are or you aren't.\nJASMIN:\nI can confirm that's exactly what someone who is royalty would say.\nZAN:\nWait, why can you confirm that?\nJASMIN:\nMy parents have some really powerful friends.\nMAX:\nJeez, that's way more interesting than what I was gonna say. Which is, like, my parents were, like, mediocre rich and like to think they're richer than they are.\nZAN:\nThat was my second guess.\nJASMIN:\nMakes sense. Zan, how are you leading us through this forest? You seem to know exactly where you're going.\nZAN:\n[I dunno noise.] Seems-- I don't know. It just-- it makes sense, right? Like-- I don't know. It's like-- it's like when you're, you know, like, how sometimes when you're you're in a place that you kind of know, and you can just sort of... find your way through.\nJASMIN:\nZan is very good with plants.\nZAN:\nI don't know why I'm good with plants. I got my job, like, a month ago.\nERICA:\nI mean, I don't know why I'm a Bard, except for the fact that I'm a karaoke-- I work at a karaoke bar. So it all seems pretty relative.\nZAN:\nGreat.\nOliver:\nDon't worry. We're all mediocre.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nWith that... Zan you've been following these scraps of cloth and you've felt the sun as it peeks through the canopy of trees every so often, brushing you with warmth. And you realize it's been getting later and later. The sun is thinking towards the horizon. As you realize this, you stop and the five you are on the edge of a small clearing. You've followed this trail of fabric south. You've been walking for a good hour and a half. I imagine most of you are very tired and have blisters on your feet, not being used to hiking through rugged terrain.\nAlice:\nDefinitely.\nOliver:\nAnd, yeah, this path has led you to-- it's been getting rockier, there some hills rising in front of you that you can see now through this clearing. And in this rocky space, you find a shallow cave -- doesn't look like it's full of bears or anything -- but it looks sheltered from the wind and from the rain. If it were to rain. And the cloth leads right up to this clearing and then beyond it.\nTalia:\nZan just shouts,\nZAN:\nCave.\nERICA:\nWhat if we stop here for the night? It seems like it's getting dark.\nJASMIN:\nYeah, uh, yeah. That sounds good.\nERICA:\nCody, do you want to look for some sticks so we can start a fire?\nCODY:\nYeah!\nAlan:\nAnd he turns his cape around to the front, so that he has front light.\n[Laughter]\nTalia:\nVery fashionable.\nOliver:\nHe's got an apron now.\nAlan:\nAnd he starts looking for sticks.\nOliver:\nOkay, great. Can the two of you make a survival check?\nTalia:\nStick check.\nOliver:\nStick check.\nAlan:\nSeven.\nAllison:\nThat's a 17 for me.\nOliver:\nYeah. Cody is mostly just pointing out funny shaped plants that he finds, but he's got his little arms out and you load him up the sticks, Erica.\nAllison:\nOkay.\nOliver:\nThe two of you have found a good amount of sticks. Do the rest of you want to do anything campy?\nAlice:\nJasmin just sits against a wall of the cave and kind of hugs herself and tries to calm down. Because it's been a lot.\nOliver:\nYou sit up against one of the walls of the cave and like most of the clearings you've been through, it's covered in this soft, squishy moss. So it's actually like a very comfortable seat that you have.\nTalia:\nZan's gonna look for, like, edible plants, just like-- I know we've got the berries, but it can't hurt to have a little extra.\nOliver:\nAll right, make a survival check.\nTalia:\n[Rolls.] Nope. That's a six.\nOliver:\nYou find a lot of weird looking plants. Every plant that you find feels alien and strange. There are ones with, like, blue leaves and like, you find this-- just off the clearing-- you find one of these trees with these fruits hanging from it. But they're like gray blobs that are kind of translucent. And inside you can see something like dark red in the middle.\nZAN:\nNah...\nOliver:\nYou don't recognize anything out here.\nZAN:\nUgh, I've got a really bad feeling about this.\nOliver:\nThere are no bananas. No apples.\nTalia:\nI'm not falling into your banana trap.\nOliver:\nYou come back with nothing.\nZAN:\nIt was a good walk.\nOliver:\nGreat.\nAlice:\nJasmin will just open the a pill bottle and offer a berry.\nZAN:\nOh.\nRobot:\nI'm just gonna generally address the group.\nMAX:\nUm, so, if we're stopping here for tonight, do we need to, like, have someone stay awake and watch?\nERICA:\nI mean, that seems smart.\nJASMIN:\nWhy? Are there bears here?\nERICA:\nI mean--\nZAN:\nWe don't know that there aren't bears.\nMAX:\nWe're in the woods, man. I don't know what's out there.\nERICA:\nWe were abducted once already. Uh... who knows how. So we might as well have some sort of precaution.\nJASMIN:\nThat makes sense.\nZAN:\nYeah. I'm not gonna put anything past these woods. I don't recognize any of this shit. There could be just, like giant mutant bears with three heads or-- eight-- No, I don't know. I was trying to come up with something more creative than three heads.\nERICA:\nA hundred talons.\nZAN:\nA hundred talons. A million wings.\nJASMIN:\nIf it's okay, I'd really like to sleep. Uh, I probably wouldn't be any use any way.\nZAN:\nI can take watch.\nMAX:\nYeah, I guess we should, like, take turns. Maybe? So we can all sleep.\nZAN:\nSure.\nERICA:\nYes. That works.\nAlan:\nCody is already asleep. Cards in hand, just deeply breathing.\nOliver:\nYeah, Cody is curled up in the cave, back pressed up against Jasmin's legs on a soft patch of moss. And he is out like a light.\nTalia:\nZan positions herself at the front of the cave. Just sort of facing outward, kind of sitting, but looking around.\nOliver:\nOh, Erica did bring you a big pile of sticks.\nAllison:\nI sure did.\nTalia:\nOh, rad. Love a good stick.\nAlice:\nCan I cast Produce Flame on it before I go to bed?\nOliver:\nYes. Jasmin easily reaches out a handful of flames and catches the sticks on fire and you've got a nice little fire. It should last you through the night with the pile of wood that Erica brought forward.\nAlice:\nShe smiles weakly at Zan and then closes her eyes.\nRobot:\nBefore I go lay down, I'll just turn to Zan and be like,\nMAX:\nWake me up in, like, four hours?\nZAN:\nSure. I'll... figure it out somehow. Okay.\nOliver:\nSo, Zan, you're sitting there. And once Jasmin lit these flames they turned a normal campfire shade of red and yellow. As you sit there, while these strangers that you met from the past few days drift off to sleep, you just keep an eye on the forest. And it's quiet. There are sounds of the forest. Chittering of animals and birds. And as the sun dips over the horizon, it just gets quieter. It's nice. Something about it feels right. You feel interested in the things around you. You feel calm. Calm, but alert. You have an uneventful watch.\nTalia:\nDuring the watch, Zan takes out Hat and just sort of lets her run over her hands like a little human hand treadmill. Just sort of let her play around.\nOliver:\nAny nerves that Hat has are calmed by just getting to hang out with you. The rest of you lay down on this moss and it's surprisingly comfortable. Maybe after a bit of anxiety and tossing back and forth, one by one, you fall asleep.\nOliver:\nJasmin, on a normal night, does Jasmin fall asleep quickly? Or is she a lay-awake-for-hours kind of person?\nAlice:\nShe falls asleep pretty quickly.\nOliver:\nGreat. You lay down next to Cody on the moss. And you have never felt as comfortable as you do right now. Your feet are all blistered and hurt and you're sore, and you've just seen so much today that you don't want to think about. As soon as you lay down you feel safe. Your hands, which are normally restless with tremors, fall still. Your eyelids drift shut and you are asleep in moments. And you dream. You dream that you're floating in a brilliant nebula. In every direction you see swirls of colors and a sea of stars. You feel calm. From somewhere around you, you hear a voice.\nDREAM VOICES:\n[Stilted speaking, multiple voices speaking over each other] Are you us?\nOliver:\n--it asks. It's familiar, but not too familiar.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nIt sounds like multiple people are speaking to you as one voice. The sound is comforting.\nDREAM VOICES:\nAre you us?\nOliver:\n--it asks again.\nDREAM VOICES:\nYou could be. You are not yet... us. You have the connection. What will you use it for? We will hold you. Grow, hatchling. Grow into us.\n=== START ENDROLL ===\nYou can find us on Twitter @dicedisasters, and we have more information about the show and the cast at DiceDisasters.com.
