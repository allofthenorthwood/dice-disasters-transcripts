Erica is wrapped up in a big, fluffy bathrobe given to her by Lili, the large, half-goat woman who has been bustling around getting you settled into their little home in the woods. Max has hidden his first cup of tea in a plant and is now holding a second cup that he doesn't want to drink. Zan is sitting uncomfortably on the couch, quietly petting Hat the Rat. Cody is curled up in an oversized armchair looking at the door. Nula, the quiet human with braids piled on their head, has just broken the news to Jasmin that turning into animals is not only dangerous but also greatly feared by most people. The four of you, Max, Erica, Cody and Zan are sitting in the living room in awkward silence. What do you do?\n=== INTRO THEME: “Elysia” by People Need Goals ===\n{01:24}\nTalia: Zan stands up, puts Hat back on her shoulder, and sort of stands there for an awkward second before just sort of saying,\nZAN: I-- I'll be outside.\nTalia: And then she walks out of the door.\nOliver: Lili, who has regained some of her composure, looks down at Cody and smooths the front of her dress,\nLILI: Well, that was very informative. Um, Cody, sweetheart, would you like to help me do the washing?\nCODY: Um, sure. I'll warn you-- I'm not good at folding.\nLILI: That's okay.\nCODY: I don't-- I'm not allowed to fold at home.\nLILI: That's okay. I'll do all of the folding. Lovely. Lovely. OK.\nCODY: OK, sure.\nOliver: She gets up and she scoops two bowls of stew and hands them to you. She trots out of the room and comes back with a pile of clothes, including Erica's stained purple jumpsuit.\nLILI: Um, Erica dear, would you get the door for me?\nERICA: Yeah, absolutely.\nLILI: Okay.\nAllison: Erica gets up, very much trying to hold the robe together, and opens up the door.\nLILI: Great um, actually, come on now, both of you. We can go sit in the sun and get this all cleaned up.\nOliver: She bustles Erica and Cody out the door and into the sunlight. As you step outside, you get a glimpse of Nula and Jasmin heading into that big glass dome in the center of the garden.\nOliver: You also see Zan on the far side of the clearing, hands stuffed in her pockets as she paces along the tree line.\nLILI: This way, this way.\n{02:58}\nAlan: Cody falls slightly behind when he looks over at Jasmin, kind of just squints a little bit, trying to make sure she's OK, but then realizes he's a little bit behind and runs to catch up.\nLILI: Come on, come on. Okay.\nAllison: Erica is also struggling to keep up with this robe trailing behind her.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Yeah, it's big and heavy.\nAlan: Cody, upon catching up, sees this and tries to, like, pick up the back to kind of get some slack off the ground.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Like a train? Like a wedding veil train?\nAlan: And tries to like help and carry it.\nAllison: And I am startled and I scream because I'm thinking that someone is pulling the robe off of me. But then when I see that it's Cody I'm like,\nERICA: Oh, yeah, thank you very much.\nCODY: Just trying to help! Sorry-- sorry.\nOliver: Okay. Between the two of you, you wrangle this giant bathrobe and Lili leads you down to the stream that cuts through the clearing. And there's, like, a few wide, flat rocks. Um, over here and Lili dumps the dirty clothes on one of them and gestures the two of you to sit on the other rocks.\nLILI: Eat, eat!\nOliver: She points at the bowls Cody is carrying and she actually pulls two spoons out of her apron and hands them to you.\n{04:10}\nLILI: Um, so, don't worry about Jasmin. Nula will take very good care of her. And you all can stay as long as you like. We never get visitors out here other than Remy, of course. And I'm so happy to host.\nOliver: And she starts just like washing the clothes in the stream.\nLILI: So, um, do you know any songs?\nCODY: I learned to dance!\nLILI: Oh, you did? I love dance. Can I see it?\nAlan: Cody looks Erica like, are you gonna join me?\nERICA: I don't know if I could manage the dance right now, but I can sing the song for you. Cody.\nCODY: Oh, please, Please.\n{04:49}\nAllison: Oh, no. What are the words to Spooky Scary Skeletons?\n[Laughter]\nAllison: [Typing] Spooky Scary Skeletons, okay.\nAllison: I look at Cody and and I, I, shyly start singing,\nERICA: Spooky scary skeletons send shivers down your spine. Shrieking skulls will shock your soul. Seal your doom tonight.\nAllison: And I want to see what Lili's reaction is to these very creepy lyrics.\nOliver: She's delighted. She is just like, lit up. Cody, can you roll a performance check--\nAlan: Already have. It's a 14.\nOliver: Oh, nice.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Cody does a pretty good dance. He's a little more nervous than last time.\nLILI: Oh, that's wonderful! I love it. [Claps excitedly.] Great.\nCODY: Well... How... I don't know-- But I have a feeling you don't have a washing machine? So, um, how do we do this?\nLILI: A machine? Oh, you, you eat, I'll do the first couple.\nOliver: And you see, she's like pulled a bar of bluish soap out of her pocket and is like scrubbing down some of the clothes and then rinsing them. And then she washes Erica's jumpsuit first and the purple goo comes right out as soon as she puts the soap on it.\nERICA: Oh, thank goodness.\nOliver: She rinses it and then pulls it out of the stream and just kind of flicks it. Like off, like, not on to either of you. And it's totally dry. And she folds it up and puts it on the rock next to her and then grabs the next thing and keeps washing.\nCODY: Uh, hey. Hey, Erica?\nERICA: Yeah?\nCODY: Um so, like, I haven't gotten to spend a whole lot of time with you. Um, cause you're-- you know, you kinda popped out of the tube a little bit after I met everybody else. But, uh, I'm-- I'm happy you're with us now.\nERICA: Thanks, Cody. I am really happy that you guys found me before you found a way out of there. Because I don't know what would have happened to me if you had left without letting me out of that tube.\nCODY: Oh, I didn't even think about that. Oh.\nERICA: Yeah, pretty scary. I'm glad that I'm here and that we have found a friend.\nAllison: And Erica smiles warmly at Lili.\nLILI: Oh, stop! Oh, I feel so-- oh, I feel so included.\nOliver: And she continues washing and is like paying 1000% attention to both of you.\n{07:31}\n[Laughter]\nOliver: She loves this interaction.\nCODY: Do you know any more dances? I mean, not right now. I see you said there's the robe, but like, yeah, are there more that we could maybe try some time?\nERICA: Oh, yeah. Um, I used to learn dances with my cousin, a lot. My cousin, Paige.\nCODY: Oh how old is Paige?\nERICA: She is actually 20.\nCODY: Oh.\nERICA: Yeah. She's 20 years old.\nCODY: That's close to my sister's age.\nERICA: Yeah we're a little bit weird to be learning these dances so old but...\nCODY: There's nothing weird about dancing.\nERICA: You're right. You're right. Thank you, Cody.\nCODY: Aw.\nERICA: You said Jessica's almost 20?\nCODY: Uh, yeah, she's-- she's seven years older than me. So-- uh, uh, she's 19. Yeah. I think she's 19. Her birthday... I don't know when her birthday is compared to now. It was coming up, but I don't know what day it is. So maybe she's 20 by now. I don't know.\nERICA: Hopefully we can get back soon so that you can spend some time with her for a birthday.\nCODY: Yeah.\nERICA: I bet she'll be really excited to see you.\nCODY: Aw, I'll be excited to see her.\nLILI: Where does your sister live?\nCODY: Oh, well, I mean, she, she goes to college, I guess. I guess you live at college. I would think home is home, where I am, but she spends most of her time over in... Kentucky? You probably don't know where Kentucky is.\nLILI: Mm... I don't. I'm so sorry.\nCODY: That's OK. It's… it’s a ways off. It takes a bit of time to get there, so I don't, I don't--- I didn't-- I don't see her often. Um, but yeah. Where does Paige live, Erica?\nERICA: Oh, Paige and I live in the same town. Um, in Monmouth.\nCODY: That's cool.\nERICA: But, uh, yeah, I miss her. Speaking of age, Lili, how-- if this isn't too rude -- how old are you?\nLILI: Oh, not not rude at all. I am 72. I turned 72 last winter.\nERICA: You don't look a day over thirty.\n{09:53}\nLILI: Oh, you're so sweet. Thank you. Um, I guess that would be weird, though if I was 30. Ah, my thirties were just... Oh, I was a mess, but, um, yeah, how old are you two?\nERICA: I am 26.\nCODY: I'm 12. I'm-- I'm the youngest in our group.\nLILI: So little, love kids.\nCODY: I'm almost not a kid anymore.\nLILI: Just a little baby.\nCODY: But I...\nLILI: So precious.\nCODY: Okay.\nLILI: Put you in my pocket.\nAlan: Cody smiles.\n[Laughter]\nLILI: Ah, delightful.\nERICA: Lili, do you happen to have any maps or anything laying around?\nLILI: Oh--\nERICA: I'd love to kind of learn more about the area.\nLILI: We do actually have a couple maps.\nOliver: Um, and she looks over at the dome, and she's like,\n{10:50}\nLILI: They're in the greenhouse and ah, why don't we go in after Jasmin and Nula have had some time to talk? Hm... do I have any other maps? Oh, yes. Actually, in my book. Um, there's a little map at the beginning. Uh, actually, ah Cody dear, um, could you go grab the latest edition from the house for me? It's a big green and silver book, and it's on the shelf above the bed. You just go in and through the living room and down the hall, and then you turn the left and you go up a little staircase, and then the bedroom's right there, and it's above the bed.\nAlan: Cody started running the moment she'd asked, and he missed the last half of what she said.\nLILI: Okay, great. Thank you sweetheart.\nAlan: So good luck, following directions.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Okay wait-- roll a perception check for your ability to find the book in the house.\nAlan: Okay.\n[Dice Roll]\nAlan: That's a 10 plus 2, a 12.\nOliver: Okay, you find yourself in the bathroom, and you're like, that's that's not right.\nAlan: While I'm in there I do go. Just cause I'm like, oh, while I'm here might as well. And then he gets distracted for a moment, looking around the room, and then realizes he needs to go find the book. And then goes off again.\nOliver: Okay, great. Yeah. You go up the staircase and there's a big, comfy looking bed with a bunch of embroidered pillows on it. And above the bed, there's a bunch of books. You just grab three of them that look right. And bring those.\nAlan: Whichever ones are semi-green, anything that could be considered green, I grab.\nOliver: Yes. So you grabbed three books and run back outside. And you hand them to Lili. And she's like,\nLILI: Oh, thank you! Oh-- um, not this one, not this one... here it is! Taming the Growth Flora and Fauna in the Yortie region and Beyond. It's my book on, I mean, well... you can probably guess. Uh, yes, uh, Nula has a way with plants. They could grow just about anything. Um, so we've been teaming up for years, making a little catalog of as many plants as we can find.\nOliver: She gestures at their extensive garden.\nLILI: Those are most of the hardy plants.\nCODY: Uh, what did you say the name of this place was again?\nLILI: Oh, um, we're in North Yortie.\nCODY: Okay, North... Yortie.\n{12:57}\nAlan: Cody pulls out a notebook and writes it down.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: So let me get this straight, your character is taking notes?\nAlan: Well, yeah--\nOliver: Awesome I love this.\nAlan: Well it's new words he didn't know.\nOliver: Yeah!\nAlan: And I think this one keeps coming up. So he bought his notebook and along with his school notes. He literally writes down just that one name, no context.\nAllison: Cody has just been told already by his parents that he really needs to start prepping for the SATs. So he's just like writing down every single new word he hears.\nOliver: God, he's making flashcards.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: And when you say that, she flips open the book to the first page and you can see a carefully hand-drawn map of the region. So you can see on this map where there's a little clearing with the house and the dome and Lili points to that and is like,\nLILI: That's us!\nOliver: And all covering the whole rest of the map are a bunch of little placement pins, like circles of places and then writing next to them. The writing in the book is in a language that you don't recognize. You can't actually make out what any of the words say, and she's like,\nLILI: Yes, so we mapped out where all of the plants around us grow. And then you can flip to the corresponding page number.\nOliver: And she flips to a page and you see this tree with these bulbous fruits hanging from it. And she's like,\nLILI: And then you can match up where we found the tree with details about it. Any, like, magical properties it has, any healing properties, whether it's toxic, all that.\nOliver: She hands you the book.\nERICA: That's amazing.\nLILI: Oh why thank you. Many years of work, um, and we both find it very relaxing.\nAllison: Uh, if when I'm looking at this book, can I tell about how big of a region the map covers?\nOliver: Um, make an intelligence check.\n[Dice Roll]\nAllison: That is not a good roll. That would be a 5.\nOliver: No, you can't tell. You're guessing not very big, but that's kind of as much as you can get.\nAllison: Okay.\nERICA: Hey, Cody, can I see that notebook for a second?\nCODY: Uh, sure.\nAlan: And he hands it over.\nAllison: Erica kind of starts jotting down just the general landscape of the area and, like, where the house and where the river is. Can I see where the blue spruce is on the map?\nOliver: Ah, yes.\nAllison: Okay,\nOliver: Yeah. You follow the little stream down with your finger, and there's, like, a big circle there. And when you flip to that page there's a drawing of a big blue pine.\nAllison: Perfect. So I'm gonna be marking down those little landmarks just so, like, orientation-wise, I kind of know where we're at and where we can go.\nOliver: Actually, when Lili sees you doing that, she says,\nLILI: Oh, you might also enjoy this then!\nOliver: And she takes the map page and flips it to the next page. And there's like, a slightly zoomed-out version, and you can see a general area a little further out. Again, you can't read any of the writing. She says,\nLILI: Oh, yes. Here-- this is us, here, in North Yortie.\n{16:26}\nOliver: Um, and she like, trails her finger south a little bit, and she points to a region marked there, and she says,\nLILI: This used to be the town of Yortie. But it burned down about, hmm, 20 years ago or so. Um, and people didn't really want to rebuild it. Yeah, so we're right up here, North Yortie. We still call it North Yortie, even though nobody lives in Yortie.\nERICA: Where did everyone move to that used to live there?\nLILI: Oh, yes--\nOliver: And Lili traces her finger further south on this zoomed out map.\nLILI: That there, that town is Fell's Keep. That's the nearest town that people still live in. So I believe most of the people from Yortie moved down to Fell's Keep, or then kept going.\nOliver: At this point there's a large river, and so she traces down the coast of that to a big circle that is marked with a little illustration of a castle. And she says,\nLILI: That's the capital, Chattan.\nERICA: Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. This is really helpful.\nLILI: You're welcome.\nAllison: And Erica keeps scribbling and trying her best to do a decent copy of the map.\nOliver: Make a performance check.\nAlan: Can Cody help by going into his backpack and handing over the colored pencils?\n[Laughter]\nAllison: So I have, like, a key that I'm creating.\nOliver: Yeah. Good. Yeah, I'd say that's advantage.\n[Dice Roll]\nAllison: Okay, that would be a 16.\nOliver: Awesome. Yeah. You make a decent-- kind of crude-- but like, at least like, spatially accurate recreation of these two maps. So you now have a map of the near region of North Yortie and the larger region.\nAllison: Perfect.\n{18:11}\nERICA: Thank you so much, Lili. This makes me feel a lot more grounded as to... kind of where we are, because it's all very new and a little bit scary.\nLILI: Oh, you're so welcome. It is just great having you here.\nCODY: I don't think you're in trouble. Why are you grounded?\nERICA: Oh, um, like, I have my feet on the ground. Like, I know where I am.\nCODY: Oh, okay.\nERICA: You can write that down too.\nCODY: I'm grounded too.\nOliver: You're all grounded.\nAllison: Um, Erica writes down \"grounded\" next to \"Yortie\" and writes down her best definition of it for Cody.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Great. You two are starting your own dictionary. Okay, let's skip over to what Jasmin and Nula  are doing. So, Jasmin. Nula lead you out of the house on day two of you are walking quietly through their gardens and you reach the edge of the glass dome. Nula raises up their hand and places it on the panel of glass in front of you. And they say,\nNULA: I think you'll like it in here.\nOliver: You feel a slight little rumbling at your feet, and the glass panel in front of you slides into the ground, leaving a doorway into the dome.\nAlice: Jasmin jumps a bit when it opens, but when she sees the insides, I think she does visibly relax a bit. She was probably kind of hunched over, hugging herself.\nOlive: Yes.\nAlice: And now she's still hugging herself, but she stands a bit taller.\nOliver: Yes. When you went outside, Teacup jumped out of your arms and went to lay somewhere in the garden. You can now see into this dome, and inside there must be hundreds of plants. There are long planter beds and stone shelves with potted plants and glass terrariums with very interesting things in them. Immediately to your left, there's this large wooden table covered in papers and potted plants and gardening tools, and then through the middle of the dome runs a stream, which you saw from outside, and it delivers some water to the planter beds.\nNULA: Go on in.\nOliver: And she gestures you inside.\nNULA: Go explore. Um, don't touch the ones marked with an X.\nOliver: And she like, puts her hands up in a X pattern, and then they pick up a watering can and start moving through the shelves, tending to the plants. What do you do?\nAlice: I will probably hesitantly get inside, but then kind of quickly get distracted by all of the different plants, just examining all of the ones that look like-- probably starting with something that looks near familiar and then going stranger and stranger until there's just the really weird plants and admiring them all.\n{21:16}\nOliver: Yeah, they come in like every shape and color you can imagine. There's some that kind of remind you of plants that you've seen before, like spider plants tumbling out of a hanging pot. You see some little trees that are planted in the planter beds. All of the fruit and vegetables -- like the things that look like they could be edible -- are strange and weird colors, and are spiky or glittery or something. But yeah, it's comforting.\nJASMIN: Uh, Nula?\nOliver: Yeah, Nula's is off, just like among the planter beds, checking some plants, but they see you come over and they say,\nNULA: Yes, dear. What do you need?\nJASMIN: I-- Thank you for letting me see these. Could you tell me about some of them?\nNULA: Oh, um--\nJASMIN: I keep a lot of plants at home, but they're different from all of these.\nNULA: Yes. Uh, yes. Why don't we... why don't we go on a little tour.\nOliver: And Nula leads you down the rows of plants and they point out which ones are safe to eat. They point out a couple which are quite poisonous and say,\nNULA: Make sure you don't touch these. Even the leaves will leave this fine powder on your fingers that will start to seep in. And it has some very bad effects.\nJASMIN: Do you keep these for medicine?\nNULA: Yes. Um, well, mostly for research. We've been collecting as many different plants as we can find for decades now, and at some point decided that maybe we should start writing it down. So Lili does most of the writing, and I do most of just the tending to the plants. But we've got a pretty decent catalog that we copy out and send down to Fell's Keep and they have someone there to make copies and distribute information about plants of the kingdom.\nJASMIN: That sounds like a nice life.\nNULA: It is. It is. We like it out here. A lot of people... we just really like the growth, you know? Down in the cities people... they don't take too kindly to people who are different. So, yeah. It's nice out here, not having to deal with any of that\nJASMIN: Are you-- uh... which one of you is different?\nNULA: Oh, um, I guess maybe you don't have this concept where you're from, but, in general, uh, people who, uh, have mutations, I think that's the long term? \"Mutas,\" you know, um, subtle mutations are in fashion. You know, antlers, goblin tails, things that are cute. Um, but not so much people who look more like Lili does. Uh.\nJASMIN: But she's really beautiful.\nNULA: Oh!\nOliver: And this is the first time you've seen Nula, like, really relax, and they kind of like, look away for a moment. Then they turn back to you and they say,\nNULA: Yes. Yes, she is. It... it really depends where you go, and we don't travel too much. Lili's family lived out east and came out here and yeah. It depends where you're from, I've heard.\n{25:11}\nJASMIN: We, we don't have the concept of the mutations-- or if we didn't-- but where I'm from, we hate things and people that are different. Just as much. I might not look very different from any of the other people that I came from, but still-- that's not every way that you can be different, you know?\nNULA: Yeah.\nOliver: Nula nods and kind of looks back over the plants, and they touch one of the brightly colored pink and purple flowering plants on the ledge. And they say,\nNULA: I think that's why we like the plants so much. When you're... when you're surrounded by plants, everyone just celebrates how different and interesting they are. And variety is a good thing.\nJASMIN: They don't judge you.\nNULA: Yes, yes, they certainly don't.\nJASMIN: I started keeping plants because there's a lot of things I can't do.\nNULA: [Positive affirmation noise]\nJASMIN: Sometimes it seems like.... the list of things that I *can* do is much shorter than the list of things that I can't do. But the plants-- I could keep them alive, even if I started with very easy ones, and they didn't care. It felt like I was being useful to something living, at least.\nNULA: That's beautiful. I... I relate to that a lot.\nOliver: Um, yes. So you and Nula spend some time walking around the greenhouse and they show you a bunch of different plants and kind of teach you at least a basic understanding of which ones are very dangerous and what to look out for and which ones have things you can eat. Do you have any specific questions about plants you want them to answer?\nAlice: Nothing specific about plants. Is there like a bench or something? Somewhere in this green orb?\nOliver: Yes. There are actually multiple benches that you could sit on.\nAlice: Okay, I imagine after a while she would sit down on a bench and after breathing in very deeply a couple times in trying to gather some semblance of bravery ask,\n{27:46}\nJASMIN: From everything that you told me... why are you not scared of me? It's-- it sounded very bad.\nNULA: Oh, it's not a-- it's not a happy story. And, uh,\nOliver: And they kind of look at you.\nNULA: You might-- I'm worried that if I tell you, that it will... it will be too hard to hear. But if I don't tell you, it might happen. So I might as well tell you. When I was very young, um, we lived in a town, actually not too far from Fell's Keep, a little... just a village, really. A couple dozen people banded together to fend off the growth and carve out a little place of safety. And I had-- I had a brother. He was a few years younger than me. And though our mother had left, when we were still very young, our dad was great. He was kind, and loving, and encouraged our love of plants and the outdoors, while making sure to keep us safe within the village walls. And around 10 or 11 years old, when magic really starts to manifest, my brother started showing signs of shifting. A shifter is a word that is thrown around in malice, in fear. It means, ah, a person who can change their shape and their form and become beasts that they see in the wild, in the growth. And my brother, just out of nowhere one day became...he became a fire lizard and I couldn't stop him, couldn't stop him from trampling through town and laying waste to that bakery and the nursery where...\nOliver: At this point Nula stops talking and just kind of stares out into the plants for a while and then they, like, shake their head and come back to it.\nNULA: They... hmm.\nJASMIN: What was his name?\nNULA: Tyrone. I don't like his name anymore. The people of the village used him as a warning for a long time after that. But I've seen what changing can do to somebody... the way that you become something else and you lose who you were. He wasn't violent. He wasn't malicious. He wasn't reckless even, as a person. But once he changed, he was... he just became something else. Something that wanted to burn and stomp and thrash. And I'll save you the gruesome ending. But... he didn't make it. And so he became just another point on a list of reasons why shifters are evil and feared.\nJASMIN: I'm sorry.\nNULA: That's alright, dear.\nJASMIN: What if I just only change into good things? Like mice and goblins, and I don't know… sheep?\n[Laughter]\nNULA: That's a good thought. From what little Tyrone told me about the feeling before he was gone. He said it was addicting. He said it was just it made him feel free and fulfilled, and he couldn't help himself.\nJASMIN: Oh, I really don't want to get addicted to being a mushroom\n{32:06}\nNULA: Yes, exactly. Have you had any training for your magical, uh, affinity?\nJASMIN: No.\nNULA: No. Okay.\nJASMIN: We were given magic by being attacked at being thrown into deadly situations and being tossed into pits and cut with swords and zapped with lightning, and the magic appeared in response, I think. Nobody told us how to do any of it or what it was.\nNULA: Humm, I've heard of places that do it like that.\nJASMIN: I was bitten by a shark.\nOliver: Whew, Nula kind of shutters at that.\nNULA: I don't like the water. That sounds horrible. Why don't why don't we just talk about some plants some more? Actually, hum. Here's a fun little spell.\nOliver: They take you over to one of the planter beds and kneel down beside it, and it's like this big box full of soil and got some like trees in it, and they take you to a section that's relatively empty. So just fresh loamy soil and they say,\nNULA: Put your hands in the soil.\nOliver: And they stick their own hands in the soil.\nJASMIN: OK.\nOliver: And then Nula leads you through a little breathing exercise. You feel your shaky hands calm a little bit in the safety of the soil, and they just keep guiding you and coaching you until you feel calm and at peace and your eyelids drift close. Then they nudge you with their elbow. And when you open your eyes, a little bundle of flowers have sprouted out of the earth around your fingers.\nAlice: I think that this is the first time since being told the story of shifters being dangerous and after the response to her revelation in the house, that this knot between her eyebrows has disappeared and she just smiles very brightly.\nOliver: Wonderful. Let's go check in on Max. Max, you're left standing in the living room, holding a second cup of tea. Everyone else left. Cody briefly reappeared and ran through the room, not paying attention to you and then left with some books. \n[Laughter]\nOliver: What do you do?\n{34:44}\nRobot: Didn't you say Lili brought out a bunch of food?\nOliver: Yes, there's a bunch of things that look like chips and some dip. And these green orbs that Cody was gorging himself on. There is also a cauldron of stew, just kind of, like, simmering over the fire.\nRobot: Okay, well, Max just kind of awkwardly waved goodbye to Erica and Cody as they left and then went back to snacking on all the things he could find and walking around aimlessly. Just looking at all the things in the room.\nOliver: Okay great, You've just eaten. Cool. Make a dexterity saving throw.\nRobot: ...Oh, okay.\n[Dice Roll]\nRobot: That's a 12. Yeah, plus nothing so a 12.\nOliver: Okay. Yeah, as you're like, wandering around chomping these green orbs. You're carrying your long sword, which you've all just had kind of like a mismatch of weapons this whole time. And you never found a place to carefully stow them. And as you're looking at some pictures framed on the wall, you turn and your long sword just kind of like knocks a potted plant off a ledge and you try to catch it, but it falls and smashes.\nMAX: Fuck, shit!\nRobot: I'm gonna try to scoop up all the pieces and get all the dirt off the floor and then look around the room to see if there's somewhere I can hide it.\nOliver: Okay, make a get deception check.\n[Laughter]\n[Dice Roll]\nRobot: That is a 7 minus 1.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: You decide to pour the remains of the potted plant into another potted plant, and as you're pouring it in there, it knocks that potted plant off also. And it's the floor and smashes.\n[Laughter]\nMAX: Oh, no.\nWINDRED: Hey, what are you doing?\nMAX: Uh, nothing.\nOliver: You turn around and the small round, woman with antlers and a broken leg is standing in the doorway to one of the other rooms. And just glowering at you.\nWINDRED: What are you doing in here?\nMAX: Nothing. I'm just, uh, eating, you know?\nOliver: Okay, make another deception check.\n[Dice Roll]\nRobot: That's a 16.\nOliver: Okay. She believes you. I guess. \n[Laughter]\nOliver: As you stuff a bunch of crackers in your mouth really fast.\nWINDRED: Well, you're... you're... you're... ugh, whatever. Know how to use that thing?\nOliver: She points at the long sword you've been dragging around.\n{37:15}\nMAX: Uh, well, no, not really.\nWINDRED: You're an embarrassment holding it like that. You're going to trash my house. Lucky you haven't broken anything yet.\n[Laughter]\nWINDRED: Alright, let's go tough guy. Grab the swords off the mantle. Come on.\nOliver: And she points above the fireplace and you see a pair of crossed swords mounted up there--one long, one short--and Windred is already limping out the door.\nRobot: Um, yeah. I'll grab the swords and follow her.\nOliver: She leads you outside. You very easily catch up with her because she is much smaller than you and limping, and she leads you to an open patch of moss at the clearing near the house. There's a pile of mossy logs in the center, just overgrown with vegetation. And when you get there, Windred like sizes you up, and she says,\nWINDRED: Hm. Start with the long sword, not the metal, the normal one--not that fairy shit you got.\nOliver: And she pulls a stick of incense from her pocket and lights it with a match, then mutters something under her breath and drops the stick on the pile of mossy logs. She shuffles backward quickly and sits on a rock. The pile of logs twitches and then unfolds to a standing position. And rooted in the ground in front of you there is a wooden practice dummy with a wooden sword in one hand and a shield on the other. And Windred sitting on the rock says,\nWINDRED: Go on, try to hit her.\nRobot: Yeah, I'm just gonna try to hit the dummy, I guess.\nOliver: Okay, great. I added a metal short sword to your character sheet, and you don't have proficiency with that. So go ahead and try that.\n[Dice Roll]\nRobot: Okay, that is 17.\nOliver: Yeah, OK, so you rear back with this metal sword, and it's awkward and you kind of two-hand bring it down and slap it right onto the dummy, and it hits. But you notice that you hit it with the flat side of the sword, not the sharp side. And Windred just starts laughing at you.\nRobot: That rings the sword like a lot. And it kind of stings my hands. So I almost dropped the sword.\nOliver: Yeah, you look sad and like an embarrassment. \n[Laughter]\nOliver: Windred is like,\nWINDRED: No, not like that!\nOliver: And she kind of, like, beckons you over to her where she's sitting on the rock.\nRobot: I'll shake my hands a little bit and then walk over to her.\nOliver: Oh yeah Windred, she's just like she's got like, it's just such a grumpy face on. But she's still kind of laughing and she adjusts year grip on this sword and then starts whacking you in the leg. And she's like,\nWINDRED: Move this one over here. Okay, try again.\nRobot: Okay.\n[Dice Roll]\nRobot: That is a 6.\nOliver: Oh, you're so embarrassed that you try to do the things she says, but you just bring it down and the practice dummy brings up the shield and, like, effortlessly blocks your sword out of the way and Windred is like,\nWINDRED: No, no, no! Stop trying to smash her. You're not going to get anywhere like that. You need to pay attention to what she's doing.\nOliver: She points to this practice dummy.\nWINDRED: See? Wait for her to make a mistake, and then you can strike.\nMAX: OK?\nWINDRED: Do you get it?\n{40:36}\nMAX: I think so.\nWINDRED: Okay, good. Do it again.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: So go ahead and roll another attack.\nRobot: That's a Nat 20.\nOliver: Oh, shit. Alright, Max, with all of your big buff boy training that you've had in your life, you take a breath and wait for the practice dummy, to kind of bring up its sword as though it was going to attack you and you slam it right underneath. You put a big dent in this wood, and it kind of like, splits off some splinters and Windred is like,\nWINDRED: Huh? Nice. Alright, maybe you're not a loss cost. OK, uh, let's try it again. But this time you could do some blocking.\nOliver: And as you're standing there with your sword, kind of like, jammed into the practice stomach side, it takes a swing at you...\n[Dice Roll]\nOliver: And gets a 13\nRobot: That will hit me without the shield.\nOliver: Okay, yeah. You don't have the shield. You've just got the sword. Um, and it brings its sword up and under and then kind of just, like, whacks you in the ribs and you take 1 point of damage. It's not a sharp sword. It just kind of smarts a little bit. Windred says,\nWINDRED: Come on, you gotta pay attention! Can you pay attention?\nMAX: Ow! Uh, yeah, I think I can.\nWINDRED: Alright, this time move out of the way, dumbass.\nOliver: Then it swings again and gets a 13.\nRobot: Same thing\nOliver: And it hits you again and you take 1 point of damage.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: And Windred says...\nWINDRED: Better, that was better.\nAllison: Robots' gonna die.\n[Laughter]\nRobot: I'm going to die to a training dummy.\nOliver: Windred coaches you through doing this for a while. She teaches you a little bit more about how to handle the sword and how to bring it down in the right way and actually dodge when something else comes to hit at you, not just stand there like a big piece of meat. And then she stops you and says,\nWINDRED: Alright, alright, you've mostly got it. You're actually... whatever. I could still kick your ass if my damn leg was healed. You need to practice against a person. Where did that little shit go?\nOliver: And starts looking around. She spots Zan over in the trees, and she says,\nWINDRED: Hey! Hey, you! Get over here!\nTalia: What?\nOliver: Windred looks at you, Max, and is like,\nWINDRED: Go get her, go get that one!\n{43:03}\nMAX: Uh, okay. You got it, Coach.\n[Laughter]\nRobot: Max is gonna go run off to try to get Zan to come over.\nOliver: Alright. Yeah, you find Zan a little bit into the woods.\nMAX: Hey, uh, you know that that grumpy old lady that we met earlier?\nZAN: Yes.\nMAX: She's teaching me how to use a sword. You should--you should totally come learn how to use the sword. It's, like, really fun.\nZAN: Ah, [Disgruntled noises], fine--\nWINDRED: [Distantly] Come on, you chicken!\nMAX: Yeah, she is kind of grumpy.\nZAN: No, I'm not chicken. You're a jerk.\nMAX: But she's like, a really good coach.\nWINDRED: Come over here and fight me, then.\nZAN: I'm not gonna fight an old lady!\nWINDRED: Fight my weird practice dummy!\nZAN: Yeah, I'm not gonna fight your pile of sticks either! That's stupid!\nWINDRED: ‘Cause she could kick your ass!\nZAN: Ah, fine.\nTalia: Zan walks back over with Max.\nOliver: Nice job Max.\nWINDRED: Nice job.\n[Laughter]\nWINDRED: Alright, drop the fairy shit. Take this.\nOliver: And she holds out a metal short sword to you, Zan.\nZAN: Okay.\nWINDRED: Try to hit him!\nOliver: And she nods at Max\nTalia: Zan has, like, a simple slow smile sort of creep over her face like,\n[Cackling]\nZAN: You want me to hit him?\nWINDRED: Yeah, hit him!\nRobot: Max has a big, dumb smile on his face. He is in a ready stance with the sword out in front of him.\n[Laughter]\nTalia: Okay.\nOliver: Go ahead and roll an Attack.\nTalia: This is going to go very badly.\nOliver: You can use your short sword, but not with proficiency.\n{44:38 }\n[Dice Roll]\nTalia: That's a 14.\nOliver: Does that hit?\nRobot: Uh, yes.\nTalia: Hahaha!\nOliver: Yeah, alright. Zan goes to swing at you and then jolts the other way and slaps you into the ribs with a metal sword. You take 1 point of damage. The sword is completely dull. And so it doesn't hurt that bad.\nOliver: Windred say,\nWINDRED: Yeah, she is better than you. Alright, try it again.\n[Laughter]\nWINDRED: Hit her back!\nRobot: Okay.\n[Dice Roll]\nRobot: That is a 20.\n[Laughter]\nRobot: Not natural, just total.\nTalia: Naw, that doesn't hit. [crosstalk] No, he absolutely does hit.\nOliver: Yeah, Zan, you're in close for that hit on Max's side, and you realize a little too late that you are way too close. And even as you try to, like, scramble backwards, he brings down the sword and just kind of, like, whacks you in the arm.\nZAN: Ow!\nOliver: You take 1 point of damage.\nZAN: Motherfucker.\nOliver: The rest of you, Cody, Erica, and I think even Jasmin from inside the dome can now definitely hear the sound of two people fighting.\nAlan: Can we see them where they are? Or is it just hearing?\nOliver: Yeah, actually, Cody and Erica, you can probably kind of see them from where you are.\nAlan: Uh, Cody immediately looks over, sees his two friends fighting and yelling, looks at Erica and says,\nCODY: Why are they fighting?!\nAlan: And then just takes off running towards them. So he's just running across the\nfield like...\nCODY: Hey, stop it! Hey, hey don't! Why?!\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Okay, so the concerned 12 year old is running towards you. Cody, as you get closer, you see these two idiots are laughing and smiling at each other. And Zan is getting ready to hit Max with her sword again. So go ahead and roll.\n[Dice Roll]\n[Cheering]\nTalia: That's another 14.\nOliver: Alright, great. Yeah. You take that hit. And you kind of like, shrug your arm off a little bit and then come back in and hit about the other side. Max, you take one point of damage.\nRobot: We fucking suck it blocking.\n{46:49 }\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Yeah you really do.\nAlice: It's almost like you don't have a shield equipped.\nTalia: Yeah, it’s almost like we don't have any blocking mechanic.\n[Laughter]\nTalia: I don't know, I’m pressing the B button, I don't know what's happening. \nOliver: Lili kind of sees Cody run off, and she’s like “oh no!” And she's, like, finished the laundry and just folds it all up and picks it up. And then she actually turns to you, Erica, and she's like...\nLILI: Oh, it's here, sweetheart. Here's your, um, suit back? Is that what you called the jumping suit?\nERICA: Yeah. Yeah, thank you so much.\nAllison: And, um, Erica is trying to pick up Cody's backpack and his notebook and the books while also trying to keep this robe wrapped around her and also carry the jumpsuit. And it's just like the most awkward mess you've ever seen.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Beautiful.\nAlice: I think Jasmin appears in the door of the glass thing, and just like, half of her is covered in dirt like her hands are covered in dirt and, like her knees are covered in dirt. \nOliver: Yeah.\nAlice: She just looks out at everyone fighting.\nOliver: Here's your little dirt monster, Jasmin, you see that Max and Zan are engaged in a sword fight, and Cody is trying to stop them.\nTalia: Come on, dudebro! Give me what you've got!\nOliver: Alright Max, roll an attack.\n[Dice Roll]\nRobot: Damn, that's a 10.\nTalia: Haha! That does not hit!\nOliver: That's what Zan yells.\nZAN: Can't touch this!\nOliver: As Max brings his sword around she jumps out of the way yelling “Can’t touch this!”\n[Laughter]\nAlan: Cody finally has made it up to this scene after running across the yard. And he's not gonna get between them because there’s swords. And he's...\nOliver: Yeah.\nAlan: He's child, but not that stupid. Um, he gets close to them and stops. He puts his hands on his knees and he's out of breath, and he goes,\nCODY: I don't know who said what stupid thing to make this happen. But swords?! Really? Why?\nTalia: Zan points at Windred.\nAlice{?}: Go Zan!\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Windred looks at Cody and she’s like,\nWINDRED: Yeah, come on, sit down. Watch the show!\nCODY: What?!\nRobot: Max looks at Cody and he’s like,\nMAX: Oh hey, are you to learn how to swordfight too? It’s like, so much fun!\nZAN: No, we’re not gonna teach the small child how to use a sword.\n{49:21}\nCODY: I shoot magic! I’m good!\nZAN: Yeah, and he’s got a stick.\nAlan: So he sits down wherever he was told to sit down and tries to figure out what is happening right now.\nAlice: Jasmin will sit down next to Cody, just pat him on the shoulder, leave a whole bunch of dirt on his shoulder.\nAllison: Erica is slowly stumbling up to the curb still, just like,\nERICA: What is happening?\n[Laughter]\nOliver: In her giant bathrobe. Yeah, Windred pauses the both of you for a minute and corrects both of your posture. Zan, when Windred brings you over and changes where your hand is holding the sword, do you listen to her?\nTalia: Uh, yeah. I think Zan’s relaxed enough since she got to get some hits in that she’s kind of putting on a bit of a show, like “Come on, I can do this by myself!” But she will listen.\nOliver: She’ll do it? Okay, great.\nTalia: She knows that she’s literally never used a sword before.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Great, okay. Windred adjusts your grip and shows you how to change your stance to get a little more weight behind your swings, and then she whispers to you,\nWINDRED: He’s not guarding his left side, go get him tiger!\n[Laughter]\nOliver: And pats your back and sends you back in there. And so I think it’s Zan’s turn again?\nTalia: Yeah, because the last thing I shouted was “Can’t touch this!”\n[Dice rolls]\nTalia: Aw, that’s an 8!\nOliver: Alright, Zan, now with the weight of everyone watching you, you run forward and then trip a little bit and headbutt Max in the chest. It doesn’t hurt, it’s awkward.\nZAN: Ugh!\nOliver: Max, are you still going?\nRobot: Yeah.\nOliver: Alright, go for it.\n[Dice rolls]\nRobot: Aw damn, that’s a… 9.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Alright, you’re laughing so hard at Zan’s whiff that when you try to bring the sword around you just miss completely.\nZAN: Haha!\nTalia: Wow, we’re such shit.\nAlan: Cody looks up at Jasmin and is like,\nCODY: If they’re gonna fight they should at least try to do something good.\n[Laughter]\nJASMIN: They’re doing better than I could.\n{51:49}\nCODY: Eh. True.\nJASMIN: You know they gave me a sword? Don’t know who would give me a sword. Who thinks that’s a good idea? At least they look like they could use it.\nCODY: They gave me a quarter of a staff. Which, like, it has to be a really long staff to only give me a fourth of it and still be as tall as me.\nJASMIN: That is strange.\nOliver: The 3 of you hang out as Max and Zan beat on each other. They’re having a great time. And then you hear a low rumble, and Lili had gone back in the house to put the washing away, and I assume Erica actually went and got changed.\nAllison: Yeah, I went and got changed as soon as I got back to the house.\nOliver: Great, you’re in your jumpsuit again. You can now move your arms and legs freely without the bathrobe check.\nAllison: I should’ve been doing bathrobe checks honestly.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Yeah! And then you hear a roar. \n[Loud, terrifying roar]\nOliver: It’s a loud, guttural sound. And crashing out of the bushes is a giant rocky beast of some sort.\nTalia: What?\nOliver: It’s on 4 legs, it’s at least 12 feet tall at the shoulder, and covered in moss and algae and dripping with gunk, and then it opens its gaping maw again and you realize it’s not yelling, it’s just the sound of two rocks grating against each other. And it breathes down over you. This giant, rocky quadruped golem lunges towards you.\n==== MIDROLL START ==== \nAlan: Well hello, and welcome to Dice Disasters! This is the part of the podcast where we stop pretending to be other people, and start pretending to be ourselves. Today we’ve got Allison with us, hey Allison!\nAllison: Hi, Alan.\nAlan: Well, surprise.\nAllison: Surprise!\nAlan: Yeah, it’s only been a week, and now we’re here again. Bet you didn’t see that coming.\nAllison: Yeah. We told you every other week, and we were telling the truth, but then we changed our minds. At least for now.\nAlan: Yes. It turns out that, you know, a lot of us in this world have some extra time on our hands and we’d thought it’d be great to give you guys out there some more content, and we found that we can make it pretty fast right now, so, yeah. For a little bit, we’re going to be going on a weekly basis.\nAllison: I’m the one that manages our social media, and I’ve seen a lot of really nice recommendations for this show that people have been putting out on Twitter and stuff. Thank you so much for that, by the way. And one of the things that people have said is that this has been something really nice to keep them company in some harder times. So we want to put out as much content as we can until it’s a little bit too hard for us to maintain. So yes, we will be going every week at least for the next little while.\nAlan: Yeah, and we’ve had a few new people who have written to us and let us know that they’re listening, and they burn through the first 6 episodes in a day and a half, and so I know people are out there really enjoying listening and we want to help fill some time with some laughter and good times. So yeah.\nAllison: Yeah. In the meantime, keep tweeting to us, keep letting us know what you’re liking, especially now that we’ve met some NPCs, which is pretty cool.\nAlan: Oh, I love these NPCs. Oliver is amazing at these NPCs. Like, I didn’t know what to expect going in, but they’ve blown my mind. So good.\nAllison: Yeah, if you guys like our characters, just wait until you meet the characters that Oliver has come up with.\nAlan: Well Allison, you mentioned reaching out to us on social media. Where can people find us on social media?\nAllison: Yes. It’s @dicedisasters everywhere. Twitter, Facebook.com/DiceDisasters, and dice.disasters on Instagram. We’ve been having a lot of fun. We just posted a trailer that Alan put together that is absolutely incredible that you should go check out, and it’s a really great way to introduce your friends to the show if you wanted to kind of give them a taste of what it’s like. So yeah, please go check that out, that’s on all of our social media channels right now.\nAlan: Yeah, it was so much fun. Oliver’s artwork already jumps off the page, just looking at it, but when I got in there and had to add some depth to it I had so much fun making that.\nAllison: Yeah, it turned out so good.\nAlan: Thank you. We are so much enjoying hearing from everyone who’s enjoying the show. If that’s you, please leave a review for us on whatever podcast service you use, or reach out to us on social media and use #dicedisasters and if you do that, we might name an NPC after you!\nAllison: Yeah. We just had a NPC in this episode, Lili, who is named after @LiliSparx on Twitter. So thank you Lili for sharing the show. And you could be next. We have a lot of NPCS upcoming. Just get out there, let us know what you think, write a review. Just a note--some people chose their iTunes names a long, long time ago and don’t even necessarily know what they are. So if you want to leave a review, and you want your name to be considered for an NPC, just go ahead and write your name at the end of the review or whatever you want. But that’s really helpful for us, otherwise we’re just pulling from whatever those usernames are on iTunes or on Twitter or whatever.\nAlan: Yeah, and another way you can get involved in the show is if you have any ideas for items for our characters to have in this universe, you can submit those on our website at dicedisasters.com that Allison here wonderfully designed for us. And you can go there and submit your ideas for Oliver to pull from whenever it’s time for us to find items or buy items or however they decide to do that. And we would love to have your ideas--funny ones, cool ones, the goofs ones--whatever you got, we would love to have them.\nAllison: You can always find our character sheets on the site as well. And some people have been joining the Discord to come and chat with us, which is really neat. The link to the Discord is on our site as well.\nAlan: Well anyways, Allison, it was great to talk to ya!\nAllison: It’s always great to talk to you, Alan.\nAlan: Aw, so much fun. But I think--I have a feeling our listeners are pretty much gearing up for what’s about to happen in the story and are like “Hey, can y’all stop this? We gotta get on with this.”\nAllison: Yeah. Thanks guys for listening again, and enjoy the rest of the show.\nAlan: Yeah, have fun! Bye!\n{58:40}\n==== MIDROLL END ==== \nOliver: Roll for initiative.\nAlice: Oh dear.\n[Dice rolls]\nTalia: I get to roll twice, because that’s the new ranger thing apparently. I get to roll twice for initiative.\nOliver: Yeet!\nTalia: Uh, it’s 11 anyway though.\nOliver: Okay.\nAllison: 18 for me.\nAlice: I got a 14 - 1, so 13.\nOliver: Okay.\nRobot: 15.\nAlan: 12 for Cody.\nOliver: Lili is just like,\nLILI: Oh no! Um, oh no, can you all handle this?! Are you… is this… I’m such a bad hostess, but could you all handle this?\nOliver: And she’s looking at you.\nZAN: I dunno!\nJASMIN: Aaaaaah!\n[Laughter]\nOliver: And Lili kind of looks at all of you and then scoops up Windred, who has a cast on one leg, and Windred is like,\nWINDRED: No, let me at it! Gimme my sword! I’m getting it!\nOliver: And Lili’s like,\nLILI: Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope!\nOliver: And runs back to the house with Windred under her arm. First up is Erica.\nAllison: Okay, I am going to cast Earth Tremor.\nOliver: Ooh, alright! Tell me what Earth Tremor does.\nAllison: So, each creature in an area other than you takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone, it’s a dexterity save.\nOliver: Dexterity save? Alright.\nAllison: For half damage and to avoid prone, but they’ll take damage no matter what.\nOliver: Alright, great. Okay, this towering, rocky golem is lumbering towards you and you watch as Erica flips through her menu and presses Earth Tremor. And Erica, on your screen, it pops up with a notification that says Sing.\nAllison: Oh, shit.\n[Laughter]\nTalia: Sing!\nAllison: Oh no, I should never have been a bard. Um…\n[Laughter]\nAllison: Well, okay, yeah. So Erica goes,\nERICA: [singing] Let’s get it started, ha,\nAllison: And that’s when the tremor hits.\n[Cheering]\nOliver: The ground around you shakes and underneath the stone golem it erupts--the ground almost just rolls--and the golem is going to try to remain on its feet.\n[Dice rolling]\nOliver: It got a 15, versus your spell save.\nAllison: Yeah, it’s 11, so it saves. But it’ll still take half damage.\nOliver: Alright, roll for damage.\n[Dice rolling]\nAllison: That is a 6, so 3.\nOliver: Great, yeah, this thing stumbles a bit but stays standing, and lets out another of those grinding yells. Next up is Max.\nAllison: Uh, quick question.\nOliver: Yes.\nAllison: I know I can use my Bardic Inspiration. Can I do that really quick?\nOliver: Yes, you can use that as a bonus action.\nAllison: So I yell to Max,\nERICA: [singing] Max, you’re gonna do a great job!\nAllison: And I give Max a point of Bardic Inspiration.\nOliver: Great. So you now have a d6 you can add to any d20 roll, and you don’t have to do it until you have decided you want to.\nRobot: Nice.\nOliver: Max, you are holding a metal longsword, but your fancy summoned one is just at your feet. So you could easily pick it up and switch if you wanted to.\nRobot: Okay, uh…\n[Chair squeaks]\nOliver: Robot, your chair is so squeaky, you have to remain completely still while you talk.\nRobot: I know.\nAlice: The sword you’re using right now is blunt, right?\nRobot: Max isn’t thinking about that, Max is going to just go right in.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Alright, great!\nAlan: So dumb.\nOliver: Yeah, you all watch as Max just runs towards this giant stone golem with his metal sword, and swings it right down into one of its legs. Go ahead and roll an attack.\n[Dice rolls]\nRobot: That is… 12.\nOliver: You do not hit. Your sword effortlessly slides over one of these rocks, and you’re just standing very close to the big golem now.\nZAN: Max, you dumbass, that’s a practice sword!\n{62:50}\nOliver: Next up is Jasmin.\nAlice: How far away from the goblin am I right now?\nOliver: Oh, the goblin?\nAlice: The golem, sorry.\n[Laughter]\nAlice: How far away from the golem am I?\nRobot: Look, Jasmin always just needs to know how far she is from that cat.\nOliver: Yep! \nAlice: I have my priorities straight. Anyway, how far away am I from this golem?\nOliver: Teacup kind of sees this happening and he was laying outside in the sun, and he twirls between your legs and trots off into the distance. You’re probably 40 feet from the big golem.\nAlice: Would I theoretically be able to get within 15 feet at such an angle that I could hit the golem but not Max with an AOE spell?\nOliver: Yes, I think so.\nAlice: Okay. Then I think Jasmin kind of runs towards the side of where Max and the golem are and aims a bit to the right and presses Thunder Wave. And then just stomps on the ground, I guess? So, Thunder Wave, creatures in an area that fail a save, which is a constitution save, take 2d8 thunder damage and are pushed 10 feet away from you--half damage on save and are not pushed.\n[Dice rolls]\nOliver: This very constitute golem gets a 17.\nTalia: Much constitute, wow.\nOliver: Yes.\nAlice: Yeah, I expected him to save, but still.\n[Dice rolls]\nAlice: That’s a 7 + 5, which is 12. 6 thunder damage.\nOliver: Yeah. Emanating in front of Jasmin, the air kind of smacks forward and hits the goblin--the golem--who veers back and lets out another of those upsetting, grinding yells. Next up is Cody.\nAlan: Okay, um, how far am I from the golem?\nOliver: Within like 20 or 30 feet.\nAlan: And is there anybody in between me and the golem?\nOliver: In a direct line? I’d say probably Max is.\nAlan: He’s gonna to step forward, in a move of just battle ready, not really necessary.\nOliver: He takes 1 step forward.\nAlan: He thinks he needs to, and holds out one of his cards that has a little yellow tint to it, and he’s like,\nCODY: Max! Duck!\nAlan: And he’s going to shoot Magic Missile at the golem.\nOliver: Nice!\nTalia: Oh no!\n[Dice rolls]\nOliver: Max, make a dexterity saving throw.\nRobot: Oh boy.\n[Dice rolls]\nRobot: That’s a 13.\nOliver: Alright, Max turns around and is like “Huh? Oh!” and then leans over a little bit. It didn’t matter either way.\nAlan: Yeah.\nOliver: I just wanted to see if Max was able to do it.\nAlan: Gotcha. I’m a fan. Okay, here we go. 3 d4s. \n[dice rolls]\nAlan: That is a 4, 3, and 5, 12.\nOliver: Damn. These beams of pink and yellow light just stream out of Cody’s outstretched hand and slam into the golem, hitting it left, right, left, and little pieces of stone just shower off to the sides. And the golem yells again, because that’s basically all the golem does, is yell. And it rolled a really bad initiative, so it’s Zan’s turn.\nTalia: Oh, rad! I am going to take my Ethereal Shortsword.\nOliver: Great, you drop the practice sword and pick up your fancy one.\nTalia: Yeah, and I’m gonna run and try to hit it.\nOliver: Roll an attack.\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: That’s a 14, and I have advantage because I am a ranger and it hasn’t gone yet.\nOliver: Nice!\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: That’s still a 14, plus 2, so 16.\nOliver: 16, yeah, that hits.\nTalia: Yeah!\nOliver: Yeah, you dig your shortsword into one of its mossy joints between two rocks and give it a good slash.\nTalia: Alright.\nOliver: Go ahead and roll damage.\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: That is 6 + 2 slashing damage, for 8 slashing damage.\nOliver: Damn! Yeah, you rip out some of the gunk keeping its rocks together.\nTalia: Woo!\nOliver: It looks the same, because it doesn’t really have a face, it’s made of rocks.\nTalia: This is exactly what I needed today.\nOliver: I don’t think I need to describe its reaction on each turn, but-\nTalia: It yells again, what do you want? \n[Laughter]\nTalia: Well you said it sounds like rocks rubbing together, right?\nOliver: Yep, it’s unpleasant for everybody.\nTalia: Just do some dice sounds…\nAllison: Here comes some foley work.\n[Sound of many dice being rolled around]\nOliver: You look in its mouth and it’s just filled with dice!\n[Laughter]\n[More awful dice sounds]\nAllison: Oh, I hate that!\nOliver: Alright, the rocky golem rears back and then brings one of its hands down, trying to slam right into Zan, ‘cause it doesn’t have a very long memory and she just hit it. It gets a 16 to hit.\nTalia: Yeah, that’s gonna hit.\n[dice rolls]\nRobot: Zan is within 5 feet of me?\nTalia: Yes.\nRobot: I will give the monster disadvantage on that attack.\nOliver: Do you have a shield?\nRobot: I don’t, I don’t, dammit. Shit. Fuck.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: You try to throw your meat body in the way and it does nothing. And Zan gets hit for 8 bludgeoning damage.\nTalia: Holy shit, alright!\nOliver: How’s Zan lookin’?\nTalia: Well, let’s just say Zan hasn’t healed since the moveshroom fight, so… not amazing.\n[Laughter]\nRobot: Whoops.\nOliver: Whoops! Alright. Uh...\nAlice: How is Zan looking on a scale from 1 to 17, or 18?\nTalia: Uh, on a scale from 1 to 18, she looks about a… uh… 5.\nAllison: Woof.\nOliver: That’s not good! And it’s Erica’s turn again.\nAllison: Okay.\nOliver: Erica, you’ve just watched this golem crush Zan a little bit.\nZAN: I’m fine!\n[Laughter]\nAllison: Erica is going to cast Healing Word on Zan.\nERICA: [singing] Zan, I’m putting all my faith in you ‘cause Max already failed us!\n[Laughter]\nZAN: Oh, I feel much better now!\nOliver: Oh my god.\nZAN: I feel amazing!\n[dice rolls]\nAllison: Okay, so that is… we’re gonna say 2.\nTalia: That’s better than nothing.\nOliver: I’m gonna say just from Dungeon Master reverence for your amazing song that she gets double that.\nAllison: Great, so 4.\nTalia: Rad.\nOliver: Next up is Max’s turn.\nRobot: Okay.\nOliver: Um, as a free action, all of you are allowed to talk to each other, like, that doesn’t take up your turn.\nZAN: So, how’s everybody doing?\nOliver: Stop, no!\n[Laughter]\nERICA: So how do we think the adventure’s going?\nZAN: Pretty good, it doesn’t seem.\nOliver: I meant you could help out the big meat boy!\nZAN: Max, use your fucking sword!\nAlan: Cody just stands there pointing at it.\nRobot: Max realizes that this sword is kind of a shit and throws it away, clicks his wrists together, and hits the button for both his sword and shield.\n{70:07}\nOliver: Yes! My genius boy who is not going to take an attack of opportunity trying to go get his sword! I love him! Do what you want.\nRobot: As a bonus action, I’m going to cast Shield of Faith on myself.\nOliver: Max goes into his menu and now he’s glowing. Like glittering, not like full jumpsuit glowing, but-\nCODY: Stop playing with magic and hit it!\n[Laughter]\nRobot: And then I’m going to hit it.\nOliver: Oh, nice, great.\n[Dice rolls]\nRobot: That’s a 1.\n[Uproarious laughter]\nAlan: Oh no!\nAlice: F.\nOliver: Alright. After all of his amazing menu work, Max rears back and he’s just way over-thinking it. He’s like “alright, yeah, I gotta put my foot here, and then I make sure to adjust my grip--oh no I didn’t learn one-handed grip!” and then he clunks his sword into the golem’s big rocky leg and it bounces back and hits him in the head. Max, you take 1 point of damage. Because you hit yourself with your own sword. It was a very good turn though, sweetie. Okay, Jasmin, your turn.\nAlice: Okay, Jasmin is going to back up about 15 feet and she’s going to summon her shield and sword.\nOliver: Oh!\nAlan: Gasp!\nAlice: Yes. And then she is going to stick the sword into the ground, then point with her sword hand at Zan and use Balm of the Summer Court, which means I can give you HP.\nTalia: Wait, why’d you get the sword?\nOliver: She wanted to look cool, shut up!\nAlice: Okay, you’ll get… 3 hit points.\nTalia: Rad. Listen, I don’t have that many hit points so this is pretty good.\nOliver: Everyone else sees a couple flowers bloom in Zan’s hair.\nAlice: Awww!\nOliver: Zan, you feel better.\nZAN: What are you lookin’ at?\nAlice: And then she is going to hold up her right hand again and summon a ball of flame and throw it at the golem.\nOliver: Nice, roll a ranged attack.\nAlice: Produce flame…\nTalia: Produce blame. Max did it!\n[dice rolls]\nOliver: Max’s fault!\nAlice: Spell attack bonus is plus 5, that would be a 13 total.\nOliver: 13 unfortunately does not hit.\nAlice: Okay.\nOliver: So Zan, you feel better and then you kind of go “whu?” and move to the side as a ball of flame shoots past you.\nJASMIN: Ah, sorry!\nTalia: Eh, at least you didn’t hit me. Why is my head itchy?\nOliver: It is Cody’s turn.\nAlan: Well, Cody’s gonna look down at his card and go,\nCODY: Well little stinker, you worked last time. Let’s do it again!\nAlan: Magic missile.\nTalia: Little stinker!\n[dice rolls]\nAlan: That is a 4, 5… 11.\nOliver: More beams of beautiful pink and yellow light shoot out of Cody’s hand and slam into this golem. A couple more chunks of rock fly off.\nCODY: Oof. How much can this guy take? Jeez.\nOliver: It is Zan's turn.\nTalia: Uh, I’m gonna hit it again.\nOliver: Nice.\nTalia: Yeah, thought that’d be cool.\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: That’s a 9.\nOliver: Alright, yeah, you were just blasted by a bunch of different energy and you feel better, but a little disoriented. Now you’re under a lot of pressure because Max is failing so bad, and you bring your sword up and hit it into the rock part of the golem and go “Rahh!”\nTalia: God, swords are just not great against rocks, huh?\nOliver: Nope.\nJASMIN: Maybe you need another one!\nZAN: I only have this!\nJASMIN: You can have my sword!\nZAN: Well, I’m not proficient in dual-wielding.\nOliver: They’re meta-gaming. Alright, next up is the golem. And it shrugs off these attacks from Zan and Max that have been missing, and it’s going to lumber forward and hit the kid who’s been blasting it with magic, so both Zan and Max get to take an attack of opportunity on the golem.\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: That’s a 6.\nRobot: That’s a 16.\nOliver: Nice! Zan whiffs, but Max is able to connect, so go ahead and roll damage.\n[dice rolls]\nRobot: It’s a… 4 damage.\nOliver: Alright, yeah, you scrape it a little bit as it lumbers by, and the golem is going to stomp right up to Cody and try to just smack you with one of its big rocky arms.\nTalia: Protect the boy!\nOliver: And it rolls…\n[dice rolls]\nOliver: A… oh! It gets a 9.\nAlan: It misses.\nTalia: Ho ho ho!\nOliver: Cody’s just so small, it kind of goes “Brrraagh!” and brings up its hand and poofs it into the ground two feet away from Cody, and--\nCODY: Ah!\nOliver: It is now Erica’s turn. The golem is standing right over the small child.\nAllison: Erica is looking at her menu disappointed, because all of her spell slots are checked, and she’s like [fear noises] and she equips her rapier.\nOliver: Okay.\nAllison: And Erica is gonna go for a stab because she doesn’t really know what else to do.\nOliver: Alright, yeah, you run up to this golem and go for a stabby-stab.\n[dice rolls]\nAllison: And that’s a 9.\nOliver: You poke it with the shiny sword. It doesn’t do anything.\nAllison: Erica is like,\nERICA: This is why I just sing!\n[Laughter]\nOliver: You poor thing! Next is Max’s turn. The golem just fucked off.\n{75:45}\nRobot: Um, I’m going to just chase after it and continue attempting to beat the shit out of it.\nAlice: At least now I think you would get advantage because of flanking?\nOliver: Yes. You run up to the golem’s butt, so you’re flanking it, roll with advantage.\n[dice rolls]\nRobot: Oh boy… uh… the highest one was a 10.\nOliver: Oof, that does not hit. You get so rage-mad at its butt, but you just kind of smack it and it’s a big rock, and it does nothing. It sucks.\nRobot: Yep!\nOliver: You feel dumb, but at least most people can’t see you because they’re on the other side of the big rock thing. Zan saw you. It’s Jasmin’s turn.\nZAN: Hey, somebody hit me with a fireball or something!\nJASMIN: What, why?\nZAN: So that I can use my Absorb Elements and then use that against it.\nJASMIN: Uh… are you sure?\nZAN: Yeah!\nAllison: Erica yells,\nERICA: Does fire even work that great on rocks?\nZAN: I dunno, somebody hit me with a water damage--no, that’s not a thing--uh, cold damage?\n[Laughter]\nZAN: I’m using Pokemon types here!\nJASMIN: I’ll try?\nAlice: I’m gonna try and lob a flame at Zan?\nOliver: Good! Yes!\nTalia: Yeah!\nAlice: Alright.\n[dice rolls]\nAlice: 10 plus 5, 15.\nOliver: Yeah, it hits.\nTalia: It hits!\nAlice: Alright, let me check damage.\nTalia: So resistance means I take half damage, right?\nOliver: Yes.\nTalia: Right.\nAlice: 1 d8…\nTalia: ROLO.\nAllison: Erica yells,\nERICA: I just healed you!\nZAN: Yeah, I’ll be fine!\n[Dice rolls, laughter]\nAlice: Ha ha ha! I rolled a 1.\nTalia: Oh, rad.\nOliver: Okay, so I think you take 1 damage.\nTalia: Alright.\nOliver: And Absorb Elements, so I think that actually went about as well as it could go.\nTalia: Yeah! I’m great at this.\nAlice: I think Jasmin is just really scared of hurting her. She creates a tiny flame, like a candle flame.\nTalia: Zan is like, smoking slightly, but gives two thumbs up.\nOliver: Yeah. You actually see what look like flames flickering around Zan’s hand, where she’s holding her sword. It is Cody’s turn, the golem is basically on top of you.\n{77:52}\nAlan: Yes. I would like Cody to disengage, use his kid-like speed to stealth and sneak between its legs and get away from the creature. I think I can go 45 feet, so I can get pretty far.\nOliver: Okay, Cody just is fucking gone. Cody says “Fuck this!” and then runs between its legs and then runs across the clearing. He doesn’t swear, he’s a small child. But Cody’s very safe now. It is Zan’s turn.\nTalia: Alright, I’m gonna hit it! Again.\nOliver: Do it!\nTalia: Um, are we still flanking it?\nOliver: Yes, if you run up to it you will be flanking it.\nTalia: Great.\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: Uh, that’s a 13.\nOliver: That does not hit.\nTalia: Son of a bitch! One of these days I’m going to be able to use my stupid Absord Elements spell.\nAlice: Does it go away now?\nTalia: Yeah, I think so.\nOliver: Yeah, it does. Zan clangs her sword into the rocks and some fire goes “pfffffw” but it doesn’t do anything.\nTalia: Ugh.\nJASMIN: That looked really cool!\nOliver: I’m so sorry, baby.\nZAN: Thanks!\nOliver: It did look really cool.\nTalia: Is my hair still on fire?\nOliver: No.\nTalia: Great.\nOliver: You actually run your hand through your hair and you come back with a handful of flowers.\nZAN: What the fuck?\nOliver: Okay, now it’s the golem’s turn. The golem is facing Erica, so it’s going to try to stomp on her.\nAllison: Love that for me.\nOliver: And it got a… a 21.\nAllison: You love to see it. That’s an absolute hit.\n[Laughter]\n{79:26}\nOliver: Alright, great. And it does…\n[dice rolls]\nOliver: ...hm. How many hit points do you have?\nAllison: 16, baby.\nOliver: Alright, let’s see. Yeah, it does, um, 16 damage to you. I promise I didn’t change it.\n[Panic noises from EVERYONE]\nAllison: Bye! It was nice knowing ya!\nOliver: The golem lets out another screeching pseudo-scream and brings it hand down and just drives Erica into the dirt, and she is flattened there--not like literally flattened--but prone, and it brings its hand back up, and she does not move.\nZAN: Oh my god.\nOliver: Next up is Erica’s turn, so I’m gonna need you to roll the very first death save.\n[dice rolls]\nAllison: That’s a 4, baby.\n[More panic noises]\nOliver: Alright, so keep track of that, that you have one failure.\nAllison: Alright.\nOliver: For anyone listening, she gets to roll a d20 on her turn and if she gets below a 10 she has failed, and if she gets 3 failed... she dies for real. In real life.\nAllison: It’s really exciting that Erica is only going to be in 3 episodes.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Next up is Max’s turn.\nRobot: Okay. Max watches the golem stomp on Erica, sulking from his previous failures, and is gonna go run over to Erica and I will… yeah. I’ll dump all 10 points of Lay Hands in Erica.\nOliver: Oh shit, alright, so you see Max rotate around the golem to the other side where Erica is and just drop his longsword and put both of his hands right on her chest and a brilliant burst of pink and purple energy just flows out of him into Erica, and Erica, you are healed for 10 hit points, and you wake up with a gasp.\nERICA: Ah, Max. Max, uh, I’m really sorry that you said you screwed up, thanks bud! How many times am I gonna die?\nOliver: Next is Jasmin’s turn.\nAlice: Jasmin looks around in a panic. How does the golem look?\nOliver: Not great. So it’s a bunch of boulders that are held together by lichen or moss, and it’s kind of limping. So it doesn’t look awesome, but it’s still standing.\nAlice: Okay.\nZAN: You could always try fireballing me again.\nJASMIN: I… uh… no. Fuck!\nAlice: And Jasmin is going to run towards it. And I think Jasmin is going to try another Thunder Wave, so another con save from the big boy, please.\nOliver: Great. You have to aim it so you’re either going to hit Zan or Erica and Max.\nAlce: Is thunder an element?\nTalia: It is an element!\nAlice: Alright.\n[laughter]\nAlice: So I’ll hit Zan with it.\nTalia: Yeah!\nOliver: Alright, great. You and the golem rolling constitution saves?\nAlice: Yes, constitution.\n[dice rolls]\nOliver: It got a 4, so it does not save.\nTalia: I got a... 10.\nAlice: My spell DC is 13, so neither of you save. I am sorry for the damage I am about to inflict on you. That would be…\n[dice rolls]\nAlice: Ah, I didn’t roll too well. I do 6 thunder damage and both are knocked 10 feet away from me.\nOliver: Oh, great! \nTalia: Oh, okay. \nOliver: So you kind of scoot them both backwards in a blast of sound that comes out of you. Erica and Max, you are now out of melee range of the golem, and it shakes itself off. And as it does that, a couple of the boulders just fall loose off of it. Got its rocks off, and then--\nTalia: No! Bad!\n[laughter]\nTalia: Bad!\nAlan: Have you been waiting this whole episode for that one pun?\nOliver: No, I just thought of it. I’m very smart and good.\nAlan: I’m very proud of you.\nOliver: Thank you.\nTalia: Stone cold.\nAlice: It rocked.\nOliver: It’s Cody’s turn.\nAlan: So the moment that the golem had smashed Erica, he had basically--like any anime character that turns around and screams and the tears fly off the sides in slow motion.\n[laughter]\nAlan: He screamed like bloody-kid-murder, like “Noooooooo!” Like, he ran away, and then that happened, and so he is angry.\nCODY: Not again!\nAlan: He’s gonna shoot Ray of Frost at the golem.\nOliver: Make a ranged attack.\n[dice rolls]\nAlan: 18.\nOliver: Nice, yeah, you hit it squarely in its nasty, rocky jaw. Roll damage.\n[dice rolls]\nAlan: That’s 5, and its speed was reduced by 10 feet.\nOliver: Alright, yeah. More rocks go flying, it basically doesn’t have a jaw anymore, it is unable to let out that rumbly scream, and it is Zan’s turn.\nTalia: Alright, come on.\nOliver: Did you Absorb Elements?\nTalia: Yeah, I’m gonna hit it!\nOliver: Hit it!\nTalia: And really try to hit it this time. For realsies.\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: [triumphantly] That’s a Nat 20 plus 2!\n[cheers]\nAlice: I think that that means the damage you get from Absorb Elements is also doubled, because all the dice are doubled.\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: Yeah, I rolled a 3, so that’s 6 plus 2 is 8, for the normal damage.\nOliver: Uh-huh.\nTalia: And then it’s one d6…\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: So that’s another 3, so that’s another 6. So that’s… 8 damage, and then 6 thunder damage.\nOliver: Uh, Zan… how do you want to do this?\nZAN: Yeah!\nTalia: Zan picks herself up off the ground after having been thrown away by the initial thunder wave and holds her sword in one hand and runs back up towards this stupid rock pile. And then jumps and jabs it into the highest part of this monster she can, and as soon as it hits, there’s this wave of sparks that ripples through the monster, and it collapses into a pile of rocks on the ground.\nOliver: Nice! Zan is perched up top, like Monster Hunter style.\nZAN: Yes, I finally got to use it!\nOliver: And lili’s in the doorway like,\nLILI: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh-\nOliver: And Windred’s like,\nWINDRED: Yeah! Yeah, did you see that? That was rad!\n[laughter]\nAlan: Cody runs back to check on Erica.\nJASMIN: Erica, are you okay?\nERICA: Yeah, I surprisingly feel a lot better than I did a few seconds ago. Thank you, Max.\n{86:53}\nJASMIN: Um, um…\nAlice: Jasmin also runs up and holds her out her hand and casts Goodberry and starts offering berries one after the other.\n[laughter]\nOliver: Excuse me, would you like a berry? How about you?\nAllison: Berry?\nTalia: Berry?\nJASMIN: Here’s a berry. Why don’t you take another one, and another one, and why not just eat a whole bunch?\nTalia: What do the berries do? I forgot.\nAllison: They satiate you.\nAlice: They heal 1 HP.\nAllison: Oh, do they really?\nAlice: Yep.\nAllison: Great, I take a berry.\nJASMIN: Why don’t you just have all 10?\nERICA: Oh, I mean, I think other people got hurt too. Zan, do you need any berries?\nZAN: I could use 1 or 2, yeah.\nJASMIN: Sure, here. I can make more of them, I can make another bunch.\nOliver: Nula is hovering over Jasmin’s shoulder and is like,\nNULA: What are those?\nJASMIN: You can have one, Nula, it says they’re good berries.\nOliver: She takes a berry and then runs off into the dome, very excited.\nRobot: Max is gonna take one and just shove it in his mouth and walk over to Zan and be like,\nMAX: This was a really good training session. Can we be, like, training bros now?\nZAN: Fuck yes. This is the best day so far.\nMAX: Fuck yeah.\nRobot: And then he’s gonna hold his hand out for what you assume is a fistbump.\nTalia: Zan has to jump down off of this monster to fistbump, but she does.\nOliver: Nice, good.\nRobot: Fuck yeah.\nAlan: Cody looks up at Jasmin,\nCODY: Um, Erica can have my berries.\nAlan: And then walks off to sit on the bench with his backpack and has a moment to collect himself.\nJASMIN: Okay.\nERICA: What I could really use is maybe a nap.\nJASMIN: Please just eat all of these berries first.\nERICA: Okay, I will eat these berries.\nJASMIN: Open your mouth. Just put them in.\nAllison: Erica’s jaw just unhinges like a Pez dispenser.\n[laughter]\nAllison: All the berries fall in.\nAlice: Jasmin is just stuffing Erica’s mouth with berries right now.\nOliver: Okay, great! That’s someone’s specific kink! So let’s go back to the story--\nTalia: No! Bad!\n[laughter]\nOliver: I’m sorry, it was a beautiful moment. I’m sorry. So the sky has been overcast for most of the day and at this point you start to feel a couple drops of rain, and then the world goes dark. For a second, you’re in pitch black darkness. And then everything returns to normal. And Lili looks up at the sky and sighs and says,\nLILI: Oh, I guess we were due for more rain.\nZAN: Wait, was that?\nOliver: And then you hear another low rumble from the woods behind you. But this time you recognize it as thunder.\nTalia: But what was the black thing?\nOliver: The darkening?\nRobot: The what?\nOliver: The darkening.\nTalia: The thing, just now, where it got all black.\nLILI: Oh, sorry, I keep forgetting about your amnesia. That was darkening, it happens when it’s about to rain, and then it happens and you wait a few seconds and then you hear thunder, and actually--oh, if you count how many seconds it is between the darkening and the thunder you can tell how far apart the rain is! Isn’t that neat!\nZAN: Okay.\nCODY: Uh, I don’t…\nZAN: It’s like lightning but dark.\nMAX: Ohhhhhh!\nZAN: Yeah.\nOliver: A good moment for the bros.\nTalia: Yeah.\nCODY: Can we go inside?\nLILI: Yes, yes!\nOliver: Lili shepherds you inside.\nLILI: Come on, let’s get inside before we get soaked again!\nJASMIN: Yes. Erica, do you need help?\nERICA: I’m actually feeling great. Those berries are wild, I don’t know if they’ve got like vicodin in them or what, but I’m feeling great.\n[laughter]\nTalia: They’re the good berries.\nJASMIN: I don’t know, I just kind of make them? I don’t know what they are.\n{90:54}\nAllison: This world doesn’t have an opioid crisis, they have a goodberry crisis.\nTalia: They do now.\nOliver: You’re on a street corner and there’s this wizened old man with a beard and he opens his jacket and he’s like “You want the goodberries?”\nAllison: Tomorrow, Erica’s like,\nERICA: Jasmin, Jasmin, I need the goodberry.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Give me a hit, I need them!\nAlice: Then for the next episode it’s like a timeskip to several months from now, and Jasmin is a drug dealer.\n[laughter]\nOliver: The important part is Erica is fully healed.\nAllison: I almost died, and now I’m fully healed.\nTalia: Yeah.\nOliver: Yeah, you’re on a rollercoaster of hit points today. So the 5 of you and your 3 hosts make your way into the house again. It’s getting kind of darker out.\nRobot: When we start going back inside, Max is going to remember something, very quickly run back, go pick up both of the abandoned training swords.\nOliver: Good!\nRobot: Put them back wherever Windred got them from.\nOliver: Yes!\nRobot: And then look over at Windred and give her a big thumbs up.\nOliver: She tries to remain grumpy, but is like,\nWINDRED: T-thank you. Okay, whatever, goodbye.\nOliver: And she stomps upstairs.\nZAN: Hey, wasn’t there another flower pot over here?\nJASMIN: I think there were two, actually.\nZAN: Huh. Must’ve… nah. Nap?\nAlan: Cody finds a corner of the room that’s cozy and sits down with his drawing supplies and just starts drawing and maybe lights up a card to give him some light. And he’s kind of decompressing in his own little way.\nOliver: Nice. Yeah, Lili lets out a big yawn, and you can see through the windows that it’s getting dark outside and probably about nighttime. And Lili says,\nLILI: Oh, um, I think I’m ready for bed. Y-you’re gonna stay, right?\nOliver: And she looks very, very eager.\nERICA: Please.\nJASMIN: I’d like to.\nLILI: Oh, wonderful!\nZAN: That would be great.\nLILI: Okay, okay, okay. So sorry our house isn’t bigger. You’ll be alright out here in the living room, the fire will keep you nice and warm. And, oh, let me go get you some blankets.\nOliver: And she goes out of the room and comes back holding probably 15 blankets and pillows of various sizes, and she puts them on the floor. And then she reaches down and picks up the coffee table, which is like--it kind of looks like someone cut down a tree, so it’s got the rings and stuff on the top. She just picks it up with one hand and kind of tucks it behind the couch. She’s extremely strong.\nRobot: Yeah, Max is awed by this.\nOliver: Nice.\nTalia: Zan is vaguely turned on.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Zan is awedin a different kind of way. Lower down. And Lili starts arranged these blankets into makeshift little beds, and is like,\nLILI: Okay, you’ll-you’ll be good here, yes. We’ll keep the fire going overnight. It’ll just keep going, I made it, it just keeps going. Um, okay, we’ll be right upstairs if you need anything at all. Do you need anything? Oh! More blankets!\nOliver: And then she goes off into another room and she comes back with probably 8 more blankets and pillows and actually starts struggling to find places to put them because she’s brought so many blankets. She’s made up 3 beds on the floor and reclined the armchair into a bed and made a bed on the couch, and she’s like,\nLILI: Okay, okay, should that be all? This probably--oh, I know! More tea!\n[laughter]\nOliver: And she goes into the kitchen and comes back somehow balancing 5 mugs of tea which she pushes into each of your hands.\nLILI: This is for you, this is for you, this is for you--and this one’s for Cody, I made it with lots of sugar! There’s also more sugar in the kitchen if you need some. Um, obviously we don’t have any milk way out here, uh… do you need anything else?\nJASMIN: I think we’re good, thank you.\nLILI: Okay, well--yes, dear?\nZAN: Do you have another one of those little green globe things? For my rat?\nLILI: Oh, yes, of course!\nOliver: And she runs back into the kitchen and comes back with a basket of about 30 of them. And just sets it on your lap and she’s like,\nLILI: Is this how many a rat eats?\nZAN: It’s--um--\nLILI: Well, just take as many as you want and put them back in the kitchen when you’re done.\nZAN: Okay.\nLILI: Okay.\nOliver: And she says,\nLILI: Goodnight, goodnight!\nOliver: And heads upstairs. And so the 5 of you are now in your cozy little makeshift beds. Which bed did everybody take?\nRobot: I thought we were going to have to fight over who we’re making take the couch and chair.\nAlan: Cody was sitting wherever in his corner he found, where he’s drawing, and I’m assuming Lili put a blanket around him while he was drawing.\nOliver: Uh-huh.\nAlan: And he is going to--not on purpose--but fall asleep mid-drawing, in that corner, not in a bed.\nJASMIN: Max, could you help me put Cody on the couch?\nMAX: Yeah, uh...\nRobot: Max will go over and, gently as he can, pick up Cody and deposit him on the couch.\nOliver: Great.\nAlice: Jasmin would’ve walked along intending to help, but then Max just picks Cody up without problems, so she’s just standing there uselessly.\n[Laughter]\nOliver: Great. Okay, Cody’s now tucked in on the couch.\nJASMIN: Maybe…\nAllison: Erica just lays down in front of the fireplace.\nJASMIN: Zan, do you want to take the chair? You got pretty hurt.\nZAN: Oh, no, I can’t--I can’t sleep sitting up, I’ll take the floor.\nOliver: It’s reclined, don’t worry, it’s flat.\nZAN: No, it’s fine, I’ll take the floor anyway.\nTalia: Zan finds somewhere closer to the door.\nRobot: I’m gonna just look at Jasmin.\nJASMIN: You can take the chair if you like.\nMAX: Are you sure?\nJASMIN: Yah.\nMAX: Okay.\nRobot: So Max will lay down on the chair.\nOliver: This chair is actually very large, and you fit comfortably up on there.\nAllison: Erica leans over to Jasmin and whispers,\nERICA: Thanks again.\nJASMIN: You’re welcome.\nOliver: It’s been a long day. You all cuddle up into your blankets, many of them, and you feel warm and safe.
