Before leaving, Zan and Jasmin investigated the deepest parts of the basement, where you found a very large plant and an even larger glowing skeleton. Crawling to the surface through a series of maintenance tunnels, you found yet more mysteries. A vibrant jungle, and a message telling you to head south, following scraps of gray jumpsuit tied to tree branches. Following Zan's lead you hiked through the forest, stopping to make camp at a shallow cave at sunset. As the first light of dawn breaks through the canopy of trees, we see Erica seated by the fire. Max roused her a few hours ago to take the last watch. In the cave, Jasmin sleeps soundly, her hand resting on the bag containing CASTR's backup data. Pressed up against her back is Cody, sleeping with his arms wrapped tight around his yellow Jansport. Max and Zan are both splayed out on the moss, snoring quietly. Erica, as the world gets a little brighter with the light of dawn, you can see that a thick blanket of fog has settled in the forest. You hear rustling in the bushes as the forest begins to wake up. What do you do?\n=== INTRO THEME: “Elysia” by People Need Goals ===\nAllison:\nI want to say--\nERICA:\nHello?\nOliver:\nYou don't hear anybody answer. You kind of see some of the leaves rustling. A bird flits through the trees. You can't really get a good look at it.\nAlan:\nCody, with the light of day, has started to stir. He's not old enough to have discovered the joys of sleeping in. So he's up early, sees its kind of light outside and heard Erica say hello. And he's like--\nCODY:\nUh, hey?\nERICA:\nOh, hey, Cody. Good morning.\nAlan:\nSo he'll kind of pick himself up, grab his backpack, and walk over and sit down next to Erica.\nERICA:\nHi. You're up really early, buddy.\nCODY:\nHow early is it?\nERICA:\nAh, good question. Um, I'm not usually up early enough to see the sunrise. Um, and I don't know what time the sun rises wherever we are, but it seems like it's pretty early.\nCODY:\nWe can... Just say it's morning.\nERICA:\nIt's morning.\nCODY:\nUh, So who were you talking to?\nERICA:\nI heard a rustling out in the bushes. It might just be like some squirrels or something, but... yeah. I just wanted to see if everyone was there because that would be a little freaky.\nCODY:\nOh, I can help you look.\nERICA:\nYeah. I mean, we don't want to stray too far because of the fog, but we could have a look around.\nAlan:\nI'd like to do, like a perception check or something to kind of see?\nOliver:\nSure. Yeah. Roll a perception check.\nAlan:\nThat is a 9.\nOliver:\nYou don't see anything particularly interesting. As you wander off a little bit from where the campfire is, into the mist, you see some animals scurrying around in the bushes, just movement. You look and then you can't quite get a glimpse of it.\nOliver:\nThen... through the mist, lumbering out of it, you see a big lump of mushrooms -- about the size of a small desk -- moving into the clearing. It's waddling forward on six short legs, which slap wetly against the dewey ground. Its back is covered in all these gray mushrooms streaked with violet.\n[DM Note: I was struggling to describe this creature, so I messaged everyone and asked \"what are some things that are the size of a desk?\" and Robot said \"slightly smaller desk\" and then \"wait, fuck.\"]\nAlan:\nCody runs over to Erica and just kind of like,\nCODY:\nUh, those mushrooms... are moving?\nAllison:\nYeah, Erica is going to gently kick whoever is laying closest to her.\nOliver:\nAnd who is that?\nAllison:\nUh, we're gonna say Zan.\nOliver:\nZan, you're kicked.\nZAN:\n[Sleepy.] Uh oh. What? No.\nERICA:\nHey, um.\nZAN:\nUm... Oh, god– What time is it?\nERICA:\nYou seem to be the forest expert here. Are you familiar with any moving mushrooms?\nZAN:\nAny moving? No. What? What?\nOliver:\nGood morning, Zan, tell us about the mushrooms.\nZAN:\nWhat-- wait--\nTalia:\nZan, just like, sits up and looks around.\nOliver:\nYeah, you see this weird lump of moving mushrooms and it's getting closer towards you, and it's going SHLURP SHLURP SHLURP. As it approaches you, a long, slimy tendrils uncoils from its back and towards. Let's say Erica is closest and... [rolls] it misses! It kind of slams into the moss at your feet, leaving a trail of the purple goo.\nOliver:\nRoll initiative!\n{5:10}\nRobot:\nEven people that are asleep?\nOliver:\nYeah, but you're gonna have to skip your turn until you're awakened.\nRobot:\nThat's fine.\nAlice:\nAlright.\nTalia:\nUh, I have a 12.\nAllison:\n19.\nAlan:\n5.\nAlice:\n4.\nOliver:\nThat fits with you being asleep.\nRobot:\n6.\nOliver:\nGreat. Erica, there is a mushroom monster in front of you. What would you like to do?\nAllison:\nI'm going to pull open my spell menu and I am going to equip my rapier.\nOliver:\nAs you press the button, in your hand a shimmering purple and pink swirly translucent rapier appears.\nOliver:\nOh, also, just as a quick little thing. Um, Zan and Jasmin left their weapons in the basement facility when they went down the ladder with the rose vine. No big deal.\nAllison:\nRIP.\n[Nervous laughter]\nOliver:\nAnyway, it's Erica's turn.\nAllison:\nOkay, I'm gonna hit that sucker.\nOliver:\nGo ahead and roll an attack.\nAllison:\nIt's a 16.\nOliver:\nThat hits. Roll damage.\nAllison:\nThat's a 4.\nOliver:\nThat's slashing damage, right?\nAllison:\nPiercing.\nOliver:\nPiercing. Oh, well, interesting. Actually, when you jab your rapier into it, it just kind of hits some squishy mushrooms and pulls back out. Doesn't seem to do very much damage. Weird, huh? Um, do you have any bonus actions?\nAllison:\nWell, I have bardic inspiration, right? I'm gonna sing to everybody in the camp,\nERICA:\n[Singing] Rise and shine!\nAllison:\nAnd hope that everyone wakes up, and I'm going to give my point of inspiration to Cody. So, Cody, that's a D6 that you can add to any roll. And you can roll your check beforehand.\nOliver:\nYeah, you can roll your d20 first and then decide if you want to add it.\nAlan:\nCool.\nOliver:\nGreat. Next up is Zan.\nTalia:\nZan looks around and realizes that she doesn't have her bow or her sword. And I think she's just gonna, like, kick it.\nOliver:\nAll right. Go ahead and roll for your unarmed attack.\nTalia:\nThat's a Nat 20! I used my foot, but I used it real good.\nOliver:\nYes, you did. So I'll make it do 2 bludgeoning damage instead of 1 bludgeoning damage.\nTalia:\nYeah!\nOliver:\nGreat. You kicked the mushroom. Beautiful. Next is the weird mushroom's turn and it is going to [rolls] extend a second tentacle. So now has two floppy tentacles, and it's going to slap one into... who's standing... Erica. And it got a 10 against AC.\nAllison:\nThat is not a hit.\nOliver:\nOkay, great. And Zan just kicked it, so it'll hit Zan, too.\nTalia:\nThat's fair.\nOliver:\nAnd that is a 12 against AC.\nTalia:\nUgh, that just hits.\nOliver:\nAll right, it slaps you and does 1 necrotic damage.\nZAN:\nOw! Gross.\nOliver:\nWow. This, this whole battle is having some low numbers, huh?\nTalia:\nWe're doing some exciting stuff, y'all.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nI would say that Erica's song woke up Max and Jasmin. So, Max, it is your turn. You just woke up.\nRobot:\nOkay. Um, I'm just gonna sit up and look around. Like when I when I sit up and look around, what– do I just see the three of them fighting?\nOliver:\nA big pile of mushrooms. Zan's foot is kind of all goopy and gross where she kicked it. She's got a big splatter of purple across her chest.\nZAN:\nYuck!\nMAX:\nUh...\nOliver:\nThey look quietly uncomfortable.\nRobot:\nYeah, I'm gonna stand up and go over, but I don't know that I'm gonna do... Anything. I'm just... really confused. I just woke up and this is really weird.\nOliver:\nGreat. You walk over and you're like \"What the fuck is this?\"\n[Laughter]\nMAX:\nWhat am I supposed to do? It's a pile of mushrooms.\nZAN:\nOh, yeah. Don't worry about it. Just go back to sleep. Whatever.\nOliver:\nOkay. [Dying.] Cody, it's your turn.\nAlan:\nUh, Cody basically has gotten himself into his own little version of action stance because he just saw battle. And so he holds out one of his little cards. A little bit of a blue tint to it, shoves it forwards, and is like,\nCODY:\nHey, chill out!\n[Laughter]\nAlan:\nFingers crossed. [Rolls] Good mackerel. I'm gonna use a point of inspiration. That was an 11... add a 5. That's a 16.\nOliver:\nYes, that hits.\nAlan:\nThat's 4 [cold damage].\n{10:13}\nOliver:\nGreat. Yeah. You blast this big pile of mushrooms and you freeze some of the mushrooms along its back. It kind of like, reels backwards, a little. SHLORP SHLURP SLORP SLORP. It doesn't have a mouth that you could tell.\nAlan:\n[Grossed out] Ughh--\nOliver:\nIt's just wet.\nTalia:\nExcuse you.\nOliver:\nAnyway, it's Jasmin's turn. Good morning, Jasmin!\nAlice:\nJasmin wakes up from from the yelling and the song and says,\nJASMIN:\nMmm.. hrm... AH!!!\nAlice:\nAnd scrambles backwards towards the wall of the cave. Doesn't do anything else. That's her turn.\nOliver:\nBeautiful. Erica, it's your turn again.\nAllison:\nAll right. So how far is this thing from me?\nOliver:\nI'd say like, 10 feet.\nAllison:\n10 feet. I'm gonna cast dissonant whispers on this thing.\nOliver:\nOkay, break me off a piece of that dissonant whispers. What's that going to do?\nAllison:\nThat is going to... the target will take psychic damage. Half, if it succeeds on a wisdom saving throw.\nOliver:\nLet's see how wise my pile of mushrooms is.\nTalia:\nCan you take psychic damage if you don't have a brain?\nOliver:\nIt has minus five to wisdom. It got a four.\nAllison:\nOh, shit, I need three d6. I'm gonna freak this thing's bean. [Rolls a lot of dice.] Oh, no, I'm not. It was 7.\nOliver:\nYou got seven damage. All right. Great. This little mushroom kind of seizes up a little and kind of slurps around in a circle. Going like [shlurping noises]. Imagine distressed slurping?\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nAnd it takes seven points of damage. It's looking pretty rough. This is a nervous little mushroom now.\nTalia:\nOh no!\nAlice:\nUnhappy mushroom.\nOliver:\nIt's Zan's turn.\nTalia:\nOkay. Zan is going to click her wrists together and look at her spell menu and realize that \"Summon Longbow\" and \"Summon Short Sword\" are buttons?\nOliver:\nYes.\nTalia:\nAnd try pushing the summon short sword one.\nOliver:\nYou push that button and in your dominant hand appears that same short sword from before, glittering and transparent.\nZAN:\nRad. Awesome. I'm really glad that worked.\nTalia:\nI'm gonna... I know it's not going to be great, but I guess I'm gonna try to like slash at the mushroom boy.\nOliver:\nDo it.\nTalia:\n12.\nOliver:\nUh, that... hits!\nTalia:\nRad.\nOliver:\nGo ahead and roll damage.\nTalia:\nIt's one d6... That is a six! That's eight slashing, then.\nOliver:\nNice. You do eight slashing damage because your favored enemy is plants. The pile of mushrooms looks very bad. It is kind of slopping around side to side. One of the tendrils is hanging limp and it... it's the mushrooms turn. [Rolls] Oh, boy! And three more tendrils appear out of its back. So now it is four of them, and it's going to try to hit Zan. And that's a 17.\nTalia:\nYeah, that'll hit!\nOliver:\nYeah, you take 2 necrotic damage.\nTalia:\nCool cool cool.\nZAN:\nOW.\nOliver:\nAnd then it's gonna hit Erica. [Rolls] That's a 21.\n{13:25}\nAllison:\nThat's a hit.\nOliver:\nAnd you take... [Rolls] [Pained] eight necrotic damage\nTalia:\nHo-- Oh, no!\nAllison:\nWow.\nOliver:\nUm, then it's gonna hit Cody.\nTalia:\nNo!\nOliver:\nAnd that's a six.\nAlan:\nDoes not hit.\nTalia:\nYes!\nOliver:\nYeah, Cody dances out of the way. And then it's gonna hit Zan again.\nTalia:\nNo!\nOliver:\nAnd that's a 21.\nTalia:\nYeah!\nOliver:\n[Rolls] Oh, you only take one necrotic damage.\nTalia:\nOh, okay. So it's more of like a [sucks in breath like she got a paper cut], like, \"ow.\"\nOliver:\nIt's like a little slap. It was wet. You didn't like it. Felt bad.\nTalia:\nZan doesn't like wet slaps. Canonically.\nOliver:\nMax, it's your turn. And you've just watched the big pile of mushrooms reach out some tentacles and slap all of your friends.\nZAN:\nYeah, Max, you want to help out this time?\nRobot:\nYeah, so now that I've seen it actively hurting like my friends. I'm gonna open up my menu and summon the javelin.\nOliver:\nOkay! A five foot long pointed spear just appears in Max's hand.\nZAN:\nShit!\nRobot:\nMax has only, like, seen someone throw a javelin before. He's never done it. So in, like--\nAllison:\nImportant question. Was the time he saw someone throw a javelin Matilda?\nRobot:\nNo...\nAllison:\ndamn it.\nRobot:\nIt's gonna be the same style because it's Olympic. So in, like, a vaguely Olympic style of like running and then just fucking overhand chucking it, he's going to throw the javelin at the monster.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nAlright, roll an attack.\nTalia:\nHow far away from this monster are you?\nRobot:\nLike 15 feet? Maybe.\nOliver:\nMaybe. I think you're even closer than that. I think you like, run 15 feet, you're five feet away and you just chuck it right in there. Make an attack roll.\nRobot:\nThat is a 22.\nOliver:\nYeah, you, you spear right through this thing, straight into the ground. It is now pinned there by this ethereal javelin. Roll damage.\nRobot:\nSeven.\nOliver:\nIt's dead!\nMAX:\nHell yeah!\nOliver:\nIt stops moving. It's dead. Its goo splatters but doesn't hit any of you.\nTalia:\nOh, thank god.\nOliver:\nMax is fully awake now.\nZAN:\nTake that, motherfucker! The worst alarm clock ever.\n{15:52}\nAlice:\nWait, can someone remind me which of them was hurt, like badly?\nRobot:\nZan? I think?\nTalia:\nProbably Erica more, so.\nAlice:\nErica more?\nAllison:\nYeah, I got 8 points of damage.\nTalia:\nYeah, I'm only down 4.\nAlice:\nOkay. Uh, Jasmin, after having been very scarily awakened, will kind of open up her menu and scroll through. And I am going to use balm of the summer court, which means that I can heal you. And I am going to spend one D6 to heal you for... [rolls] Six!\nAllison:\nHell, yeah.\nTalia:\nWe're doing good d6 rolling.\nOliver:\nYeah. You watch as Jasmin hits something in her menu. And a nice, like, comforting swirl of pink light flows down her arm and her hand, and she reaches towards Erica and it... Erica, you feel a lot better. That slap from the mushroom thing felt really bad.\nERICA:\nYeah. Thank you so much, Jasmin. That thing hit me... Ugh, it felt like death.\nJASMIN:\nUh, yeah. Uh, what is it?\nOliver:\nRoll an investigation check on it.\nAlice:\nActually, not too bad at that... [Rolls] Not when I roll a six, though. So, an eight.\n{17:10}\nOliver:\nYeah. There's just kind of like a wet lump of mushrooms that are, where they've been cut open, are like oozing purple goo. It smells like death and rot. Um, there is something, like shiny on its back, but it's kind of like, shiny and oozing.\nJASMIN:\nIt's really gross... But maybe I can find out more with this scan thing? It's... I mean, scanning is for information. Right? So, uh, I'll just scan it.\nAlice:\nBeep.\nOliver:\nJasmin pushes the button and a little scanner ray moves up and down, covering the mushroom thing in light. And, Jasmin, you now have a 3D rendering of the mushroom nasty guy in your SPEL band.\nCODY:\nUh. Didn't you say that we were gonna make another rat... But I don't want another one of those! Don't make another one of those! That wasn't fun!\nZAN:\nYeah, I'm gonna have to vote for not that.\nJASMIN:\nNo-- No, I-- I don't want to. I just-- I just thought maybe it would give me information or something.\nCODY:\nOh.\nOliver:\nNo, you got a little like 3D rendering of it in your SPEL band now though.\nJASMIN:\nUm, I have an image of it. It's much better because it doesn't have a smell.\nCODY:\nOh, great. Now we can look at the thing that tried to kill us.\nOliver:\nYou can remember it forever! Jasmin is travel blogging.\nZAN:\nGreat.\nOliver:\nJasmin, as you're looking at your menu, you notice that you have 3 temporary hit points that you didn't have yesterday.\nAlice:\nHuh.\nOliver:\nIt's weird.\nAlice:\nThat is weird.\nOliver:\nAnyway, you also feel great. You slept really well last night.\nAlan:\nUh, Cody shoots a Ray of Frost at the dead mushroom thing. Pew! Just making sure.\nOliver:\nYeah. Make an attack roll.\n[Laughter]\nRobot:\nOh, no. We're gonna get another frosted tips situation.\nAlan:\nOh, no, it's a 9.\nOliver:\nThat's fine. It's not moving, it's dead, and you're, like, five feet away.\nTalia:\n[Sarcastically] It dodges! Whoa!\n{19:20}\nOliver:\nWhoa! A beam of frosty light shoots out of Cody's hand and slaps into the mushroom. It kind of like sprays some goo everywhere and sends a tiny, shiny object flying.\nAlan:\nCody runs over to see what the thing was.\nCODY:\nUh, what?\nOliver:\nUm, yeah. You find what looks like actually a golden necklace. It's kinda gooey, but yeah, it's got, like, a heart shaped pendant.\nCODY:\nUm...\nAlan:\nHe picks it up and he kind of tries to wipe off the goo on his pants. He's like,\nCODY:\nAh, I found a necklace! I don't want it. Who wants it?\nJASMIN:\nOh, can I see that?\nCODY:\nSure.\nAlan:\nHe just runs over and hands it to Jasmin.\nOliver:\nYeah, he hands you a gold chain, that's a little knotted, and there's a big heart shaped pendant on it with a blue gemstone in the center.\nJASMIN:\nThis is kind of tacky, actually, but it's not bad.\nAlice:\nCan I tell if it's like, real gold?\nOliver:\nMake an investigation check.\nAlice:\nOkay. 18.\nOliver:\nYeah, you, you try to think about how people tested if things were gold, and you, like, bring it up to your mouth like you're gonna bite it, and then you're like, \"Wait... gross.\" And you, like, walk over to somebody with a sword and get them to kind of like, poke it the metal a little bit and yeah, it bends. It looks like it matches up with being gold. It's very shiny and pretty\nTalia:\nAnd now it's got a cool dent in it.\nAlice:\nI think Jasmin has gold jewelry, so she probably has some idea how to tell.\nOliver:\nYeah.\nJASMIN:\nIt would be pretty valuable, if we could find someone to sell it to. Unless one of you wants it. It would look pretty good on Erica.\nCODY:\nBut... how? Okay, I froze the mushroom creature and it spit out a necklace. This doesn't make any sense.\nZAN:\nYeah. I'm not thrilled at any of the ideas of how this thing got a necklace.\nJASMIN:\nIt's a mushroom. It probably-- it probably just fell onto the ground and then mushrooms grew over it.\nCODY:\nOr it went to the mall?\nJASMIN:\nOr it went to mushroom mall.\nCODY:\nAh, that sounds gross.\nZAN:\nOkay... what?\nJASMIN:\nMall-shroom.\n[Cody Laughs]\nZAN:\nAll right. Okay. Should we keep going for the day?\nERICA:\nYeah, let's uh--\nJASMIN:\nShouldn't we have breakfast first?\nZAN:\nYeah, got any more of those berries?\nJASMIN:\nYeah, I do, actually. I saved some from yesterday.\nOliver:\nJasmin reaches into her bag and pulls out some hot pink berries. Hands them out. You can each have a little berry snack.\nCODY:\n[Chomp.]\nERICA:\nYum yum.\nOliver:\nYou can regain one hit point.\nAlice:\nD&D party can have little a berry as a treat...\n[Laughter]\nAlice:\nAs a breakfast a treat.\nTalia:\nNow we're more likely to find items after we catch one another. I make sure that Hat gets a little bit of berry too.\nOliver:\nShe nibbles it up.\nTalia:\nYeah!\nOliver:\nShe wants to sit on your shoulder.\nTalia:\n[With love] Of course she can sit on my shoulder!\nOliver:\nThe next scrap of great jumpsuit fabric is at the edge of the clearing.\nZAN:\nShall we?\nJASMIN:\nMmhmm.\nCODY:\nOkay.\nERICA:\nYeah. Lead the way.\nTalia:\nWe go!\nOliver:\nYeah, as you make your way back into the woods and start following this trail again, the fog clears as the day turns into like real morning. It's bright and the forest is alive around you. You see a lot of weird looking trees in strange colors, and you pass a couple that are like, 12 feet in diameter and just shoot off into the sky. Big flowers. Birds kind of flit in and out of view in weird colors. As you walk through the trees, you hear the sound of running water and you're just walking.\nAlice:\nI don't want to derail the podcast by asking to scan every creature I come across. But can I scan a bird?\nOliver:\nWhen you try to scan a bird the button has turned gray for the day, and it just kind of goes like [error noise] when you push it.\nAlice:\nAw. Okay.\nTalia:\nAs part of my forest abilities, I should be able to tell when I'm tracking other creatures how long ago they passed through the area. Can I, like, tell that with these gray scraps and the sort of trail we're following?\nOliver:\n[DM excitement] Oh, hell yeah you can. Zan, refreshed after a night's sleep in the forest and just rearing to go back into it, stops and takes a good look at these scraps of fabric again. She kind of like, bends down and looks at the earth and touches it with her hand and then looks up. Zan, you know that whatever left this, this trail, was here nine months and four days ago.\nAlice:\nWow, that's specific.\nOliver:\nShe knows that.\nTalia:\nThat's a lot longer than I thought it was gonna be.\nZAN:\nYeah, we're following a really cold trail here.\nJASMIN:\nHow cold?\nZAN:\nLike nine months. Four days.\nJASMIN:\nAny idea about the hours?\nOliver:\nYou just accept that?\nZAN:\nI'm gonna say... six.\nJASMIN:\nMinutes?\nZAN:\nAh, five. I'm just making it up at this point.\nJASMIN:\nSeconds?\nZAN:\nAnd [with confidence] 27 seconds.\nJASMIN:\nMilliseconds?\nZAN:\nNo.\n[Laughter]\nCODY:\nUh hey, how... how do you know?\nZAN:\nDirt.\nCODY:\nOkay, dirt's never told me anything like that before.\nZAN:\nI don't know, just the way that it's been, like, sort of packed down. And the way that stuff's grown over this cloth and how old the cloth looks and--\nCODY:\nIs talking to dirt one of your superpowers?\nZAN:\nGod, that would be the worst superpower, wouldn't it? Can't imagine dirt has anything good to say. Just like, \"Ugh, I've been stepped on. UGh.\"\nCODY:\nYou don't play in enough dirt.\nJASMIN:\nYou could be a dirt detective.\nERICA:\nI imagine the dirt could be like, \"Yeah, I'm 1/10 dinosaur dust.\"\nZAN:\nBut, like, aren't we all?\nERICA:\nAren't we all. Good point.\nZAN:\nYeah.\nOliver:\nSo, yeah, you're all making your way through the forest. The trail of fabric leads you to a stream and then turns a little bit to follow along the bank. You walk for another few hours. How's everyone doing with this hiking adventure?\nAlice:\nPretty bad. Jasmin is very winded, very quickly. Probably trails behind a bit.\nOliver:\nYeah, it's been a couple hours of hiking rugged terrain, and Zan doesn't seem bothered by it at all. She's kind of pointing out where you all can step and as you follow behind her it doesn't feel as difficult as it looks like it would be based on how much vegetation there is. But it's still tiring.\nAlan:\nCody has a whole bunch of kid energy, so he goes a pretty good while before getting tired. He just more gets bored and anything else, so he just, if no one's being very talkative, he'll just kind of pick up a rock and kind of play catch with his mage hand. Kinda throws rocks off the path, Mage hand goes to get it, either throws it back or brings it back to him. He just kind of entertains himself, making up games.\nOliver:\nThat's amazing. I love that.\nRobot:\nMax is doing fine with the hiking, and he's gonna try and stay like in the back-ish, just to make sure nobody like, falls too far behind.\nOliver:\nAh, my sweet boy. All right. Yeah, you're pretty much just walking with Jasmin at this point, then. Because she is decidedly at the rear.\nTalia:\nZan is like pointing stuff out so that other people don't trip over it, but she's also, like, not slowing down for other people. I feel like occasionally they might have to be like, \"Hey, whoa, calm down a little bit.\" This feels great. I'm just, like, hiking.\nAlice:\nThat would probably have to be Max who's saying that because I don't think Jasmin would speak up.\nAllison:\nI think Erica, might be like,\nERICA:\nHey, Zan... let's take a little breather,\nAllison:\n--every once in a while. Because Erica's getting pretty winded too.\nOliver:\nGreat. So we got our three at the back. Zan's just rushing forward. Cody's playing catch. Yeah, OK, you keep walking through the woods. Zan, you're decidedly at the front, and eventually you see that the trees are thinning up ahead, and you step out into a clearing. The stream you've been following winds across this clearing, passing through a large glass geodesic dome, surrounding the dome is an extensive garden with every color and shape of plant you can imagine. At the edge of the garden is a round little house made of stone. The house is smothered with flowers and vines, with a few scrappy little towers built on top that look like they were added later. The windows are all shuttered, but a small plume of smoke trickles out of the chimney. What do you do?\nZAN:\nOh my god, there might be more people.\nTalia:\nZan's just gonna, like, charge for the house, I think.\nOliver:\nOK, great.\nTalia:\nI wanna talk to somebody.\nCODY:\nHey Zan! Come back!\nZAN:\nNo, come on!\nOliver:\nYeah, you make it to this clearing a couple seconds after Zan does. She's up at that house.\nAllison:\nErica is very cautious and is hanging back, kind of trying to stay tucked behind the trees and is telling, like Max and Jasmin,\nERICA:\nUh, I know Zan's full into this, but I don't know if this is a good idea to go charging into a home of-- who knows who.\nZAN:\nI mean, I'm not gonna go in. I'm looking like, knock.\nJASMIN:\n[Winded] I don't really know. I mean, could be anything in there.\nOliver:\nAlso, Zan probably had to yell that from across the clearing.\n[Laughter]\nZAN:\nIt's fine! Come on.\nCODY:\nThis looks like half of Epcot. Like the ball.\nZAN:\nEpc.\n[Laughter]\nMAX:\nNo it's a cot.\nZAN:\nI like mine more. Which half is it?\nCODY:\nThe top half, duh.\nOliver:\nHe is correct.\nZAN:\nDoes that mean that it's like, Pco?\nCODY:\nI don't know. I just... I haven't seen a dome like this before, except for that one time we went to Epcot and I walked up and there's this big ball. That's all I was saying.\nJASMIN:\nWhat's... What's Epcot?\nAllison:\nI imagine we're just all yelling at each other. Does anyone come out? Like all these people yelling at each other?\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nNope!\nTalia:\nZan goes and knocks on the door of the cottage.\nOliver:\nYou hear a voice.\nWINDRED:\nComing, coming!\nOliver:\nYou hear a clattering inside the house, and then the top half of the door opens and you're face to face with a small round woman with short grey hair topped with a pair of antlers. She looks like she's in her mid sixties and is very surprised to see you. She stands there speechless for a moment and then scowls and shuts the door.\nWINDRED:\nGo away!\nZAN:\nWha--\nWINDRED:\nWe've got nothing to steal, and I've got more important things to do than kick your hides.\nZAN:\nWhat? Why would-- what-- You have antlers!\nWINDRED:\nFuck off!\nZAN:\nWhy do you have antlers? Hey, lady. What? We're not gonna steal anything. What?\nAlan:\nFrom far back as we were, could we see the antlers?\nOliver:\nNo. You probably saw someone open the door, and saw someone there, and then they shut the door on Zan.\nZAN:\nFriggin' rude.\nAlan:\nOk. Upon seeing a door shut, I think Cody would be more be interested. Saw movement, and so he's going to kind of start running his way forward to join Zan.\nOliver:\nGreat. You make it to this little house. Um and you can hear some, like, clattering and stomping coming from inside.\nCODY:\nWhat? What happened? Who--\nTalia:\nI knock again.\nZAN:\nCome on. You're-- Come on. You're like the first person we've seen! We've, like, just walked through the half of the goddamn forests from the weird old building thing. We don't know where we are. We don't-- Come on. We think we've been kidnapped... or something.\nCODY:\nHey, Zan?\nOliver:\nYou hear shouting, again, but this time from above you. And when you look up, you see the little woman peeking out from a window in one of the towers. Cody, you can see that she has short gray hair and antlers on top of her head. She says,\nWINDRED:\nYou best be skedaddling! My wives will be home soon and they don't take too kindly to trespassers.\nZAN:\nWe're not-- [Sighs].\nCODY:\nHey, hey, hey!\nZAN:\nWhat?\n{31:29}\nCODY:\nDon't-- Don't be-- Don't be mad. Let's be nice. We don't know if this Narnia lady is uh.. is mean. Don't have to yell.\nCODY:\nUh, hello. I'm Cody. And we just walked a lot and we woke up this morning being attacked by mushrooms. So do you know-- any idea about what's going on? Hello?\nWINDRED:\nYou got attacked by the moveshrooms? Hah! Amateurs.\nJASMIN:\nWhat? Moveshrooms... I was going to call them shamblingions.\nCODY:\nWell, we were just doing our best. You seem to have a really cool home here.\nWINRED:\nI told you there's nothing to steal.\nCODY:\nI don't steal things.\nZAN:\nCan you tell us where we are?\nWINDRED:\nYou're in the woods, dumbass.\nZAN:\nThanks.\nJASMIN:\nUm, maybe we can trade something for some information.\nZAN:\nYou want an old gray jumpsuit?\nOliver:\nShe scowls when you bring out that jumpsuit. She says,\nWINDRED:\nUgh, not one of those. No one wants one of those.\nZAN:\nWhat is it?\nAlan:\nCody looks over at Jasmin on kind of waves Jasmin forward.\nJASMIN:\n[Whispering] Yes, Cody?\nCODY:\nUm. I know I gave it to you as a present, but...\nJASMIN:\nYou want the necklace?\nCODY:\nMaybe she'll want it.\nJASMIN:\nIt's a good idea. Um, at least she might be able to tell us something about.\nCODY:\nDo you mind?\nJASMIN:\nNo, no.\nCODY:\nOK.\nJASMIN:\nExc-- excuse-- Excuse me...\nWINDRED:\nWhat do you want?\nJASMIN:\nUm, first off, I'm sorry. Uh. Oh. I'm Jasmin. We don't know your name. It's kind of rude not to have asked. Sorry.\nWINDRED:\n[Grumbling.] Windred, she/her.\nJASMIN:\nThat's a lovely name. Um, since... uh... maybe we can, we can trade? We found this necklace?\nWINDRED:\nHmmm...\nOliver:\nThis is the first time she actually looks like she's paying attention to you. You holding up the necklace.\nWINDRED:\nWhat's that?\nJASMIN:\nI... Well, it's a gold necklace. Kind of heart shaped.\nWINDRED:\nOh, uh, jewelry? No, thank you. Um, hmm. You want to do a trade?\nJASMIN:\nYes. Is there anything else we can offer you?\nWINDRED:\nYes. You know what? Yes. Go get me the griffinberries from down the river there. The big gold ones in the bush under the blue pine. Only blue pine for miles, right on the bank of the river, can't miss it. You bring me those berries, then we can talk.\nOliver:\nThen she's gone from the window and she slams the shutter.\nZAN:\nFuckin' rude.\nJASMIN:\nWell, we did just show up at her house and yell at her. It's OK. It's a stressful situation. It makes sense to be angry. Just...\nCODY:\nSo back in the forest? To find some berries? I guess.\nERICA:\nYeah, I guess so.\nAllison:\nDid we pass the river on our way in?\nOliver:\nYeah. You've actually been following, like, pretty close to it, and it passes right through this clearing and to the other side.\nZAN:\nGreat. Let's go get some berries for this weird fetch quest.\nOliver:\nAll right. Yeah. Okay. You go to the other side of clearing, and that's where the, the little stream river thing leads back into the woods.\nAlice:\nWhile we're walking, since this is pretty close by here, I imagine Jasmin is having an easier time now--\nOliver:\nYeah.\nAlice:\nCan Jasmin just... to test something out... press the rat button on Wild Shape?\n[Laughter]\n{35:11}\nOliver:\nYep. Here we go. The five of you make it to the other side of the clearing, and as you're just getting back into the woods, Jasmin vanishes.\nZAN:\nShit!\nCODY:\nWhat? What?\nZAN:\nUh--\nCODY:\nJasmin?\nOliver:\nJasmin, you feel your whole body just shrink. And from-- you were used to seeing the tops of people's heads, suddenly you see the sides and then the bottom, and then their butts and then their knees. And then you are very, very small and scared. You feel scared. You want to run away and hide.\nAlice:\nI run away and hide.\nOliver:\nUm, yeah, Jasmin is gone.\nZAN:\nWhat the fuck? What? Jasmin?\nAlan:\nI hope you follow our spinoff podcast Rat in the Forest.\n[Laughter]\nAlice:\nJasmin's life as a rat!\nAlan:\nRough life, ain't it?\nOliver:\nJust, \"Aaaaaaaah!\"\nTalia:\nI'm gonna look for Jasmin?\nOliver:\nOkay. Make a perception check.\nTalia:\nThat's a 21.\nOliver:\nNice. You know that Hat is on your shoulder because you can still feel her there. But you see her.. again. On the ground. And then she darts off the side of the path and you can easily follow her.\nZAN:\nI-- Oh, my God! Wait-- Rat! Follow the rat-- not my rat-- new rat! Different rat! Jasmin rat?\nOliver:\nOkay, Yeah. Zan takes off through the forest. Make a dexterity check if you want to try to catch her.\nTalia:\nUh oh.\nAllison:\nDon't squish her.\nTalia:\nThat's a 19.\nOliver:\nOK, Jasmin, you make a...\nAlice:\nDexterity save, maybe?\nOliver:\nYeah.\nAlice:\nThat would be an 11.\nOliver:\nAlright, you run into the woods and you scoop up Second Hat. You now have two Hat.\nTalia:\nIt's like that video of that guy who can find moles under golf courses.\n[Laughter]\nTalia:\nJust like, plunge a hand into the ground and bring up a rat.\nAlice:\nYes.\nOliver:\nThe rat has purple eyes.\nZAN:\n[Confused noises.]\nAllison:\nDoes the rat have tiny silver bracelets?\nOliver:\n[Smiling] Yes, it does.\nMAX:\nOh my god.\nZAN:\nOh my god.\nAlan:\nCody runs up and says,\nCODY:\nOh, did Hat get free-- oh. There's two of them?\nZAN:\nAh-- I, um-- So I think this-- this rat was where Jasmin was? Are you Jasmin?\nOliver:\nUm, Jasmin--\nAlice:\nYes.\nOliver:\nYou are suddenly just scooped up into the sky. You scramble your little legs around, but can't find purchase. And then you are looking at the towering face of Zan and you can understand everything she's saying to you.\nAlice:\nUh, just a tiny, tiny rat head nods.\nZAN:\n[Distressed] Ohhhkay-- It just-- I think-- I don't know. It might have just twitched, but I think it nodded at me. I mean, I think she nodded. I think Jasmin nodded at me as a rat.\nAlice:\nCan I make, like, a double thumbs up with my rat hands?\nOliver:\nYes you can.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nYes you definitely can.\nZAN:\nThat's really creepy.\nAlan:\nUpon hearing Zan exclaim that the rat was Jasmin, Cody's eyes got wider than they've ever been in his entire life. And upon seeing the thumbs up, Cody's mouth drops and he's just standing there agape.\nZAN:\nCan you-- Can you change back?\nAlice:\nRat shrug.\nZAN:\n[Distressed] Okay.\nAllison:\nErica runs over is like,\nERICA:\nYou know, at least she's not the mushroom monster.\n[Laughter]\nERICA:\nThat would be a much more unpleasant experience.\nOliver:\nJust squish, squish, squish.\nTalia:\nI put Jasmin-rat on my other shoulder, I guess.\nZAN:\nYeah, um, you can ride up here.\nOliver:\nHat does a double take, but then is like, okay, and kind of goes over and cuddles her a little bit.\nAlice:\nAw.\n{39:17}\nZAN:\nOh-- Jasmin-- I hope interacting with my rat is okay. You're also a rat, so I don't-- I don't know. Ah, well. I-- Berries?\n[Laughter]\nERICA:\nYep.\nAlan:\nCody looks at Max and just goes,\nCODY:\nI know I'm only 12... But this is a really weird day.\nMAX:\nMagic is weird, man.\nCODY:\nI like shooting things.\nZAN:\nHave you never heard of the rat part of puberty? That wasn't a funny joke. I'm so sorry.\n[Laughter]\nZAN:\nLet's just keep going. Can we find some berries? Please?\n{39:54}\n===== START MIDROLL ====\nAlan:\nHello! And welcome back to Dice Disasters. This is the part of the show where we stop pretending to be other people and start pretending to be ourselves. Today with me I have Alice. Hello Alice!\nAlice:\nHi!\nAlan:\nThank you so much for joining me for this wonderful midroll.\nAlice:\nYes. Um, I am very happy to be here.\nAlan:\nWhat is it like to roleplay as a rat?\nAlice:\nUm, I think it was very ratifying.\n[DM Note: AAARRRGGGGHHH.]\nAlan:\nOh, Alice, you're perfect. We released officially two weeks ago. And it's been so much fun to see people tweet at us or comment on instagram or do fan art. And we want to thank everybody who's already listened to our first 5 episodes and we hope you are enjoying the sixth.\nAlice:\nIt's been absolutely amazing just seeing everyone sharing the things they like and just knowing that.. It's fun enough to do these things, with all of us, and then that other people enjoy it as well is just so wonderful.\nAlan:\nYeah, I've really loved hearing when people give quotes that really make them laugh or, you know, they just really enjoyed, like, one of our first ones we got from someone was Matthew's -- listening on Spotify -- quoted your \"we are not cookies!\" line on Twitter. And I was like, \"Oh, I love that line too!\" I like seeing people interact. It's just great. We've had so many cool people-- Kayla, @thegreatsassby, shared some of her favorite moments.\nAlice:\nWe have some fanart already as well.\nAlan:\nYeah, I know. I saw Lulu doodled Max and his glowing jumpsuit and posted on Twitter.\nAlice:\nOne of the best parts of the podcast.\nAlan:\nYeah! Yeah, we've had some really good art, and actually, a lot of art has been happening on our discord we have for fans.\nAlice:\nYeah, it's linked on the website isn't it? You can just click on it and then join?\nAlan:\nYes, it is. You can just go to our main website and scroll down a little bit. And there's a big discord icon that Alison designed for us. Speaking of our website, where can people find us, Alice?\nAlice:\nOur website is DiceDisasters.com, that is, \"Dice Disasters\" all together. No fancy shit going on there on. And that is, incidentally, also just the name of our twitter. And just as a combo breaker on instagram, we do have some fancy shit in that there is a period between Dice and Disasters just to shake it up. (Instagram\nAlan:\nYeah I guess you keep things interesting. Keep people guessing. You know, I don't know where we're going.\nAlice:\nWhat will they do next?\nAlan:\nYeah. No, but yeah, if you want to share things you love, or art you've made, feel free to tweet or post on instagram. You can join our discord and post there. But what would really help us out -- since we really want as many people to be able to be along for this adventure as possible -- if you would review our show on whatever podcast system you use, apple podcast, Google podcasts, whatever, that would be phenomenal. That really helps. You know, the all the crazy algorithms... share our podcast with other people so we can have more people join us. And Alice, if someone leaves a review or shares the show with #DiceDisasters, what might happen?\nAlice:\nWell, considering that this show is more than just us, and Oliver plays so many different people, we kind of need some names to name them. If you leave a review, that might be your name! Or I guess, some other name if you want. I don't know. Can, can they suggest other names if they want? Can I-- If I want to share this, if I want to review it and I would want someone to be called Chicken Master 3000 with that work?\nAlan:\nUm, that's a question that Oliver would have to answer, and they're not here, so...\n[DM Note: Hell yeah you can.]\nAlan:\nWhat I want to say is, hey, give it a shot, see if Oliver will do it. You know.\nAlice:\nLook forward to our next episode, featuring Chicken Master 3000.\nAlan:\nI mean, I can't promise that Oliver would use a name like Chicken Master 3000. You might be better off with, you know, a name that you might fit the story better, but you never know.\n[DM Note: He's wrong. Chicken Master 3000 is fully on brand.]\nAlice:\nFinally, if you are on the website anyway and you like to do homebrew content, we have a submission form where you can submit item ideas, and if you do so we might just end up buying it.\nAlan:\nI love our goofs! We had a wrench and we made that awesome. And I'm ready for more stuff to do more awesome stuff with.\nAlice:\nAnd that was just a wrench!\nAlan:\nIt's just a wrench. Nothing special about it.\nAlice:\nI already submitted one myself. I don't know about you.\nAlan:\nYou did?? Don't tell me. I want to be surprised. Thanks for listening. Episode six. We'll get back to the episode. We hope you enjoy it. Episode Six turned out to be one of my favorites, so I really hope you enjoy it as much as I do. OK, bye!\nAlice:\nBye!\n=== END MIDROLL ===\nOliver:\nYou walk for probably a little more than half an hour, 45 minutes, before you see a bright blue tree that is towering above the rest of the trees. It's a least like eight feet in diameter, and the bark is a deep blue shade of like, shiny indigo and then beside it there's a large bush right on the river bank that is just covered in beautiful berries. They look like strawberries, but they're bright gold.\nZAN:\nGod, what I wouldn't give for some fucking normal berries.\nERICA:\nI'm just surprised-- When she said blue pine I thought she meant like a spruce or something. But no, this thing is legit blue.\nOliver:\nIt's very blue. All the bark is blue. The needles are blue. It's pretty.\nAlice:\nRat-Jasmin does like a big, open-mouth gaze of wonder with like, her rat face in her rat hands like,\nJASMIN:\n[Gasps]\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nIt's very cute. Zan can't see it, but everybody else can.\nERICA:\nAll right, let's get some berries.\nZAN:\nYeah, berry time.\nOliver:\nOkay, Great. What are you doing?\nTalia:\nGrabbing some berries and putting them in our-- I don't know-- pockets?? Like-- what? Do we have any kind of container? Anything?\nAllison:\nI mean, I think a few of us have a bag. Right?\nOliver:\nAre you all just gonna have bags full of loose berries?\n[Laughter]\nAlan:\nI mean, I already got one in my bag. I can add more to it.\nAlice:\nAre there like plants or trees with, like, big leaves around?\nOliver:\nUh, make an investigation check. Or a perception check, sorry.\nAlice:\n12.\nOliver:\nYeah, you look around and there's like a bush, just like, actually pretty close to where the griffinberry bush is, with big flat leaves.\nAlice:\nYeah, OK, Jasmin will jump off Zan's shoulder and run over to this bush and try to pluck a leaf-- or like, nibble on the stem so that it breaks.\nOliver:\nOh, yeah, if you nibble it, you can nibble that leaf right off. It tastes kind of bitter and gross. But yeah, actually, while you're under there you see a big silver feather. It's under the bush.\nAlice:\nI take the leaf over to Zan.\nOliver:\nYou bring them the leaf.\nAlice:\n...and then I go back for the feather.\nOliver:\nOkay, Zan, Hat number two brings you a big leaf -- that looks like you could fold it in half and have a nice basket for your berries -- and then runs off again and come back trotting very happily with a beautiful silver feather that is just gleaming and is about-- probably about the length of your forearm.\nTalia:\nI want you all to know that these-- this is probably the softest faces you've ever seen Zan make because, like, rats carrying things in their mouths is so cute.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nYeah, she's she's gotta, like, lift her head up a little bit and is kind of like trotting with it.\nTalia:\nLike I know this is Jasmin, but I also I think Zan's just like,\nZAN:\n[Sweetly] Hey, what you got there? Oh, my god, is that a feather? Good job! No wait-- [nervous laughter as she realizes what she's doing.]\nOliver:\nYou hear Zan's voice make sounds that you have never heard from this gruff small bitch.\nAlice:\nIf rats could blush.\nOliver:\nSo, yeah, you gather a bunch of berries in this folded over leaf. And you have a big, shiny feather. What do you do?\nAlan:\nUm, so Cody is standing looking at the tree, this big blue tree and because he's completely got distracted from the task at hand--\nOliver:\nYeah. Oh, it's very shiny.\nAlan:\nOf course. And he's like,\nCODY:\nUm... maybe I should climb it? I want--\nZAN:\nWhy?\nCODY:\nWell, we don't know where we are... And we just found a house next to a big Epcot bubble. Maybe there's more things to know about nearby. We could see it... if I got up there and saw...?\nZAN:\nHow good are you at climbing trees?\nMAX:\nHave you ever climbed a tree before?\nCODY:\nWell, um I tried once. Ah, it went kind of okay, but I-- we could-- I don't have to. I just was... It's pretty and I want to climb it.\nERICA:\nIt's not a bad idea, Cody. Um, Max, are you a proficient tree climber? I just don't want to send a 12 year old to fall to his death.\nCODY:\nWell, I have feather fall if it goes wrong.\nERICA:\nOh, that is true.\nZAN:\nSeriously, that's fair. Climb away, kid.\nERICA:\nYeah, go for it.\nAlan:\nBecause Cody's a little more hesitant than that... Can I do a nature check to see how sturdy Cody thinks the tree looks? And find a pathway up?\nOliver:\nYes. Okay. Make a nature-- actually, just make an investigation check. It doesn't have to be nature.\nAlan:\n[Rolls] Wow, ooh... that's just... That's a 2 + 2. That's a 4.\nOliver:\nYeah, he could definitely climb this tree. It looks great.\n[Laughter]\nAlan:\nOh no. That was supposed to be my, my smart roll. Um... okay.\nOliver:\nYou are confident you can climb this tree.\nAlan:\nIt is with that confidence that I'm gonna roll this d20 like it's never been rolled before and hope for something good.\nOliver:\nYou could make either an athletics or an acrobatics check.\nAlan:\nI'll go with acrobatics.\nOliver:\nOh, yeah. You, the child with, like, minus 12 strength is going to go with acrobatics?\nAlan:\nHe certainly is. [Rolls.] Well, it's an 8.\nTalia:\nOh no.\nOliver:\nAll right.\nAlan:\nI hate this dice.\nOliver:\nYou watch Cody, kind of like, roll up the sleeves of his bright red hoodie and size up this tree. And then he runs forward. Kind of like, scrambles up it a little bit, catches one of the lower branches, pulls himself onto his stomach so he's like-- his legs are dangling and then... he just kind of stays there for a bit. He's like eight feet up.\nCODY:\nI'm doing it! I'm doing it!\nZAN:\nYou, uh, you need help?\nCODY:\nI mean...\nOliver:\nCody, you don't feel like you could go any more than this.\nCODY:\nI mean, is-- is it high enough do you think?\nAlan:\nCody thinks he's made it pretty high, and he looks out. Can he see anything different?\nOliver:\nMake a perception check.\nAlan:\n12. 10 + 2.\nOliver:\nYeah, a couple... I'd say, like 10 or 15 feet above you, you actually see that the branches make kind of like a V shape up there, and there is like, a big nest like nestled in there. And you see some shiny silver feathers sticking out of it that are very similar to the one that the second-hat brought you.\nAlice:\nHat 2, the sequel.\nTalia:\nThe squeakuel.\n[DM Note: Seriously, fuck you guys.]\nOliver:\nYou look, kind of look to the sides... just like a lot of trees.\nCODY:\n[Whispering] Hey... guys? Guys, there's-- there's a nest up here. Like a bird nest? With feathers? Like that one? Um... I don't wanna be up here anymore.\nZAN:\nUm...\nAlan:\nCody's gonna jump and hit feather fall to get off as fast as possible.\nTalia:\nOkay. Zan's gonna very quickly realize that she has rodents on both of her shoulders and try to, like, guide them both into her bag.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nAll right, Jasmin, do you go in the bag?\nAlice:\nOkay?\nZAN:\nListen, I know it's not very dignified, but rodents don't go very well with any kind of large birds.\nOliver:\nYes, actually, as soon as you understand what Zan is communicating to you, you really want to hide.\nAlice:\nYep. Scurry into the bag.\nOliver:\nYeah. They curl up and hold each other. Hat kind of pets Jasmin's head a little bit with her tongue. She's like, this is a baby.\nZAN:\nI think there's a bit of berry somewhere in there.\nOliver:\nLet's resolve. So, Cody is eight feet up, and he casts feather fall. Um, so make sure you mark down your spell slot there.\nAlan:\nI did.\nOliver:\nAnd then yeah, he just ah, kind of floats down... Cody's about five feet tall, actually. So it's like three more feet to the ground. It takes, um, like, four seconds to make it that far because he's falling very slowly.\nAlan:\nHe's just enjoying it.\nOliver:\nPhew. Cody, you did it. You made it.\nCODY:\nYeah, I went so high! I was so high. I made it safe to the ground. Perfect. Couldn't've done better.\nZAN:\nGreat.\nCODY:\nOkay, let's get out of here. I don't want to be... I don't like that nest...\nZAN:\nWe should go.\nERICA:\nLet's get these berries back.\nZAN:\nYeah.\nOliver:\nYou all start heading back towards the house, just walking along the stream. Do you take Jasmin and Hat back out of your purse now that you're clear? Or are they just kind of like hiding in there?\nTalia:\nI'll sort of ask Jasmin if she wants to come back out.\nAlice:\nJasmin very, very cautiously pokes her nose out and looks around. And then one she notices the coast is clear she does come out.\nZAN:\n[Quietly] God, that's so adorable.\nOliver:\nYou back on Zan's shoulder?\nAlice:\nYeah.\nOliver:\nYeah. All right. You guys are walking back through the woods following the stream. I assume Erica or somebody is carrying this bundle of berries. Maybe you grabbed multiple leaves and multiple bundles of berries and then... Zan's kind of leading the way, and then Jasmin's on her shoulder, and then they both fall into a big pile.\nZAN:\nFUCK!\nMAX:\nOh, no.\nJASMIN:\nI'm sorry! I'm sorry.\nZAN:\nAre... are you okay?\nJASMIN:\nYeah, I have-- I'm... I'm okay. I didn't know it was going to, uh, do that.\nZAN:\nCool.\nERICA:\nIt's a good thing you weren't in the bag anymore.\nJASMIN:\nOh, yes, that was, uh...\nCODY:\nJasmin, you turned into a rat!\nJASMIN:\nYeah, I did.\nCODY:\nA rat! You! That's cool.\nJASMIN:\nIt was....\nOliver:\nAre you just kind of, like, in a heap on top of Zan on the ground? Or did you get up?\nAlice:\nNo-- I got up.\nTalia:\nYeah.\nAlice:\n--and offered her hand.\nTalia:\nZan does not take the hand. I think she's suddenly, like-- she knew this was rat was Jasmin. But also, she's like, remembering all the faces that she made at it? And will just, like, nod and then sort of stand not looking at anybody.\nOliver:\nGreat.\nJASMIN:\nI guess...\nZAN:\nIt was great. Yeah. Uh, good? Good. I'm good. Yes. Sorry. Uh, glad you're okay. Shall we go? House?\nJASMIN:\nUh, yeah. Ah, I'm-- I'm sorry.\nZAN:\nNo, you're--\nJASMIN:\nI guess it doesn't summon, huh?\n[Extremely uncomfortable laughter.]\nZAN:\nHouse time!\nOliver:\nAre Erica, Max, and Cody just kind of... standing there watching this happen?\nAlan:\nCody looks up, at Max and Erica, and then back up Max and goes,\nCODY:\nWe have a freakin Animorph on our side! Wow.\nMAX:\nHow do you know Animorphs? Aren't you a little young for that?\nCODY:\nOh, um my-- my dad had all the books, and when I didn't want to read school books one time, he, uh, he gave me those to read instead. And I read those.\nZAN:\nYou only didn't want to read school books one time?\nCODY:\nShh!\nZAN:\nGod, you're a nerd.\nOliver:\nZan is so great with kids.\nAlan:\nCody just rolls his eyes.\nJASMIN:\nI like school books. I always eyes red ahead. But then I didn't remember anything, so it was completely useless anyway. But I had fun. Uh, yeah. Good.\nAllison:\nErica ruffles Cody's hair and just walks past everyone towards the house.\nJASMIN:\nHouse? Berries?\n{57:00}\nOliver:\nYeah, you make it back to that clearing with the house and the dome and the big garden. And as you enter the clearing, you hear a rustling in the bushes. Like, 20 feet away from you. And then laughter. And from the forest steps and older person in a simple grey tunic and leather boots leaning on a walking stick. Long, dark braids are coiled on their head and their eyes are a soft shade of brown. And their laughter cuts off abruptly when they see you, turning into surprise.\nZAN:\nGod, someone else talk this time.\nOliver:\nAnother voice calls out from the forest,\nLILI:\nOh, Nula, did I ever tell you the story of the goat with the two heads--\nOliver:\nAnd behind this person, a towering giant of a woman steps out of the forest. She must be at least seven feet tall, with waves of white hair that cascade over her tanned, muscular shoulders. She has a wide, flat nose, long, furry ears and flowers peppered throughout her hair. A pair of black horns jut out from the top of her head and curl down to her chin. She's wearing a green dress that ends at her knees, and you see that her legs are very furry, and instead of feet, she has hooves.\nAllison:\nErica is very tired of walking and just goes up to them and is like,\nERICA:\nDo you guys live here?\nLILI:\nWell, hello. Oh, my goodness. Yes, we do. Welcome. Welcome. Come on in. Nula do you see that we have guests-- of course you see that we have guests-- Windy! Windyyy! Do you see that we have guests?\nOliver:\nThe giant woman eagerly steps up to you and shakes Erica's hand.\nLILI:\nI'm Lili, she/her, and this is our wife Nula, they/them or she/her.\nOliver:\nShe points towards the person with the walking stick who just kind of nods... slowly.\nLILI:\nAnd that's our wife Windred, she/her, at the house over. Windy! Windy get the tea! We have guests!\nOliver:\nWindred, who you met earlier, is standing in the doorway of the house and she rolls her eyes and limps back inside. And you can see that she has a big cast on one leg.\nLILI:\nOkay, come, come, we'll start up a fire and you can rest and drink tea and oh-- are you hungry? Nula, let's make a stew! We can use those black roots that we found earlier by the springs!\nOliver:\nAnd Lili starts bustling around getting firewood from behind the hut and she, like, waves you towards the house that she has bounded off towards.\nJASMIN:\nUh, we brought the berries?\nLILI:\nYou brought the what?\nJASMIN:\nThe berries?\nOliver:\nYou see Lili's at the house with her head cocked and Windred's just back in the doorway, and she's like, laughing.\nWINDRED:\nYes, bring the berries to me. What good children you are. Good.\nAllison:\nErica trudges in.\nZAN:\nDid you actually need these berries?\nWINDRED:\nYes. Stupid. I need the berries. Come on.\nZAN:\nUgh.\nAlan:\nCody runs in and just joins Lili wherever she is.\nOliver:\nYou enter into this little house. It's very cozy. You enter into this round joint living room and kitchen. And there's a fireplace with a fire going, a big lumpy couch, and a very large armchair. And there's a couple rugs on the floor. And there are plants everywhere. Little pots with flowers and leafy things. The house smells like cinnamon.\nAlan:\nCody is in that armchair. Just sitting.\nOliver:\nYeah, Cody, you climb up in that cozy armchair, and it's great.\nAlan:\nAnd he's just sitting there bouncing.\nOliver:\nYeah, Lili comes over and she hands you a cup of tea in a big, like purple mug.\nLILI:\nThis is for you. What's your name, dear?\nCODY:\nOh, hi. I'm Cody. Thank you for the tea and letting us-- This is a cool house. Thank you.\nLILI:\nOh, I'm so glad that you love my house. What are your pronouns, dear?\nCODY:\nUh uh, he/him?\nLILI:\nGreat! Thank you.\nCODY:\nWe stayed in the cave last night!\nLILI:\nYou stayed in a cave?? Oh you poor thing. Oh, my goodness. Where did you come from? How did you end up all the way out here?\nCODY:\nUh...\nOliver:\nLili hands out these mugs of tea, she pushes them into your hands and then, like, shepherds you towards the coach.\nAllison:\nErica's helplessly standing in the middle of the floor, arms full of berries. Is just like looking around, like,\nERICA:\nWhat-- Somebody tell me what to do with these.\nOliver:\nYeah, you're looking around and Windred it is there, the round lady with the antlers and she just, like, takes the berries out of your hands. She's like,\nWINDRED:\nGreat. Heh heh heh.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nAnd then leaves. She goes off into another room with the berries. And Lili then replaces the berries with the tea and she, like, gently shepherds you towards the couch and sits you down.\nLILI:\nSo who are all of you? How did you get all the way out here? We never get visitors. It's been what? Nula, how long has it been since we have visitors?\nOliver:\nAnd Nula kind of like... looks at her, and Lili's like,\nLILI:\nYeah, we think like nine months. Nine months sounds about right. Um...\nZAN:\nNine months...\nLILI:\n[Nervous] Who are you?\nAllison:\nErica gestures down and says,\nERICA:\nDid they happen to be dressed like this?\nLILI:\nOh, my God. Yes. Oh, gosh. You're are just covered in purple slut. Did you meet one of the moveshrooms? Those little rascals.\n[Crosstalk]\nTalia:\nPurple what?\nRobot:\nI'm sorry-- did we get another slut moment?\nAllison:\nSlut moment number two!\nOliver:\nWhen did I say slut??\n[Laughter]\nRobot:\nPurple slut??\nAllison:\nI'm covered in purple slut.\nTalia:\nJust COVERED in purple slut!\n[Laughter]\nAlan:\nDo you wanna take that one again, there, Oliver?\nOliver:\nUUUGGGHHHH.\n[Laughter]\nAlice:\nI mean, personally I vote for keeping this in.\n[Laughter]\nLILI:\nWell, you're covered in purple sludge. [Emphasizing] Sludge. I guess.\nERICA:\nYes, we ran into the moveshrooms. Uh, not a great time. Are there, are a lot of them around here?\nLILI:\nI would say there's more than usual. Nula, would you say that there's more than usual?\nOliver:\nAnd Nula just kind of like, looks at her, and Lili's like,\nLILI:\nYeah, I'd say more than usual. We had, we had a lot of rain in the past couple of months, you know, being spring. And then, um, I think when the water kind of like sits there in the in the mud and then the mushrooms come and they're like, \"mmm, yeah! Yummy mud!\" And then they grow and then they walk around and they're just.... They're so silly. I like them. They're very purple, but yes, all these stains...\nOliver:\nShe gets out a rag and starts wiping at your jumpsuit to like, clean it off.\nJASMIN:\nIs \"moveshrooms\" their official name?\nLILI:\nOfficial?? Um, well, uh-- [Laughter]\nOliver:\nShe's, like, kind of blushing at this point. And she's like,\nLILI:\nI have some publications on the various flora and fauna in our region. I don't know if I would call it official by any sense, but my books are pretty popular.\nAllison:\nErica is very stiffly standing, and it's so uncomfortable just being rubbed down by a stranger.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nShe is oblivious to that. She cleans off all of the goo, and she's like,\nLILI:\nOh, this will stain. Do you want to just take it off? And I can put it in the washing with the rest of our stuff and get you a big housecoat to bundle up in?\nERICA:\nYeah, that would be great. That sounds perfect.\nLILI:\nOkay, Wonderful.\nOliver:\nAnd she, like, bounds off into another room and you hear some like, clattering and clanging. Nula just sits on the floor in sips on the tea.\nJASMIN:\nI really wanted to ask if I could read her books.\nOliver:\nLili comes back, and she has probably the biggest, like, fluffy bathrobe thing that you have ever seen in your life. And she's like,\nLILI:\nTake this. The bathroom is just-- you just go out of this room and you go into the hallway and you turn right, and it's right there. You just take that off and leave it on the floor. Um, I'll-- I'll clean it up. Yeah, just wear this.\nERICA:\nThank you.\nLILI:\nOh, you're so welcome. What was your name again, sweetheart?\nERICA:\nErica, she/her.\nLILI:\nOkay, great. Erica, yes. Just go right in there. Get cleaned up.\nZAN:\nWhat exactly is this region? Where are we?\nLILI:\nOh, we're in... North... Yortie.\n[DM Note: I made this place name up on the spot.]\nLILI:\nUm, we're probably... I think we are-- Uh I mean, it depends how you travel, if you go by. Ah, let's see... Walking, I think it takes about a week or so to get to the nearest town. And... Yeah. Is that-- Where where you all from?\nZAN:\nThis is going to sound like a weird question. But, uh, what planet is this?\nLILI:\nUh, Pturrah. Are you all right, dear? Sorry, dear. What was your name?\nZAN:\nAh, I'm-- I'm Zan, Sorry. She/her.\nLILI:\nOh, Zan.\nZAN:\nYeah. Um. We don't know how we got here.\nOliver:\nLili, kind of, like, looks at each of you and settles on... Jasmin. And then she reaches out her hands and puts them over Zan's ears, and makes it see you can't hear anything. And she says to Jasmin, she's like,\nLILI:\nDid she hit her head?\nJASMIN:\nUh--\n[Laughter]\nLILI:\nDoes she have amnesia?\nZAN:\nHey-- wait--\nJASMIN:\nMaybe, actually, but no, we-- we just... we all...\nOliver:\nAnd she take her hands off and she's like,\nLILI:\n[Concerned] You all have amnesia??\nJASMIN:\nNo, no, we just feel-- we-- well, maybe? We were from all different places. And then we suddenly woke up together in this weird room, and now we're here, and we have no idea where we came from.\nCODY:\nI'm from Missouri.\nJASMIN:\nI'm from Vienna?\nLILI:\nI don't know either of those places, um...\nZAN:\nWe're from Earth?\nLILI:\nOkay... I've never been there.\nZAN:\nOkay. Cool.\nLILI:\nI mean, I haven't been very many places. We've lived here for-- How many years have we lived here now?\nOliver:\nAnd she looks at Nula, and Nula just kind of like, looks at her. She's like,\nLILI:\nYeah, I think, like 42 years?\nJASMIN:\nYou said we were on Pturrah?\nLILI:\nPturrah, yeah.\nJASMIN:\nSounds like it could be \"Terra.\" Terra is Earth, Zan.\nLILI:\nI had a friend named Tara when I was really little. She was so sweet. She had, um she had, like, almost wings? People made fun of her because she didn't quite get the whole flying thing, but I thought they were super cute and they thought they went really well with her hair.\nZAN:\nDo you know about-- There's, like, a big facility near here? Not... not too close. But...\nOliver:\nWhen you say that, they all look at you. You notice that Windred is back in the doorway and she says,\nWINDRED:\nHeh. I knew it. I think they're from one of those Sapien Strongholds.\nZAN:\nWhat?\nOliver:\nAnd Lili says,\nLILI:\nWindy. You can't say that!\nZAN:\nWhat?\nOliver:\nAnd Windred says,\nWINDRED:\nYeah, there's a big one a few days from here. Uh, look at them. They're staring, they're clearly dumbstruck, they're wearing those ridiculous, impractical outfits. It's obvious. So did you escape? Did you get kicked out? Are you \"corrupted?\"\nOliver:\nAnd she does air quotes when she says that.\nZAN:\nWait, What? What do you know about those... Sapien Strongholds?\nOliver:\nLili's like,\nLILI:\nUm... you know... a lot of hearsay, you know... a lot of gossip. I mean, we don't get very much gossip out here. Um, we have met a couple people like you, a couple of... your people?\nOliver:\nShe looks at Nula and she's like,\nLILI:\n[Whispering] Is that right? Is that the right thing to say?\nOliver:\nAnd Nula, like, shrugs and Lili's, like,\nLILI:\nYou know, un... gifted... folks without any ma.. gic.\nAlan:\nCody's teacup is now lit up.\nLILI:\nOh, you do have the gift! Oh, I knew it. I just, I could smell it on all of you. Oh, that's wonderful. When did you learn to do that, young man?\nCODY:\nUm, they... they gave us magic at the big underground thing that we woke up in. And now I can do magic.\nLILI:\nOh.\nAlan:\nCody's looking on the room. Kind of trying to catch every else's gaze. Make sure he's not saying something bad. He's like, um,\nCODY:\nWe... we all got magic.\nJASMIN:\nYeah. Apparently it was either this or become juice.\nLILI:\nOh, no, that is just awful.\nOliver:\nAnd she reaches over, and she just scoops Cody up into a hug. Cody, it's a very soft hug.\nCODY:\n[Smothered] Oh-- Oh! Thank you!\nLILI:\nOh, you poor thing. You poor little babies.\nCODY:\n[Smothered] It's okay! It's okay!\nOliver:\nWindred is like,\nWINDRED:\nThey're a bunch of freaks, that's what they are.\nOliver:\nAnd then she shuffles back, out of the room.\nZAN:\nHey, look who's talking!\nWINDRED:\nFuck off!\n[Laughter]\nAllison:\nAt this point, Erica has slowly trudged back into this room, like, absolutely swallowed up by this bathrobe. It is, like, embarrassed of her situation, is like hiding in a corner.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nGreat. Yes, it's not a very big room. There's not a lot of places to hide. But you kind of like sit on some throw pillows in the corner. I assume you like, tuck the robe over cause you're naked underneath.\nAllison:\nI sure do.\nZAN:\nGood look. Very avant garde.\nRobot:\nMax is a big boy. I assume there isn't room for Max on the couch. So Max is kind of like, standing behind the couch. And he's just been watching everyone talk. And Max has never had, like, real tea before. So Max is like holding the teacup very high and, like, takes a sip and then trust of very surreptitiously spit it back in the cup.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nOkay?\nRobot:\nAnd then he's just gonna put the tea down somewhere. And then go stand back behind the couch.\nOliver:\nThere's a potted plant nearby. Um, make a sleight of hand check.\nRobot:\nThat is 13.\nOliver:\nOkay. Yeah. You put your teacup in the potted plant. It's... it's hidden. No more tea for Max.\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nLili puts Cody down, and she turns and she looks at all of you just like,\nLILI:\nOh, you-- Oh! I forgot to get you tea!\n[Laughter]\nOliver:\nAnd she gets up and she runs to the other room, and she comes back with a cup of tea, and put it into your hands. And she's like,\nLILI:\nWhat is your name, dear?\nRobot:\nMax looks a little scared of the tea in his hand, and he's like,\nMAX:\nUh, my-- Hi. I'm Max.\nLILI:\nMax. What are your pronouns?\nMAX:\nOh, he. He/him.\nLILI:\nOkay, great. Here you go. Here's a nice warm tea. Make sure to drink that all up.\nZAN:\nYeah, the tea is great, but could you, like, talk more about what you know about the facilities? Like, have they always been there? Are they like relics? Does anybody go in them?\nLILI:\nOh, um, well,\nOliver:\nShe like shifts kind of uncomfortably and, like, looks at Nula. Nula looks at her and then she looks back at you and she says,\nLILI:\nWell, um, what I know-- and it's not very much. I mean, we've kind of, like, lived out here for a long time. We haven't been to any of the major cities and, like, oh... When was the last time we went to one of those... we went down to Fell's Keep?\nOliver:\nShe looks at Nula, Nula looks at her, and she's like,\nLILI:\nYeah, I think we were there, like, three years ago. Um, I don't really hang around much... Um, kind of big. It's hard to, you know, fit in. But, um, yeah, I guess it's weird talking to somebody about something they know more about than, you know. Right? Um, so you're from one of the, um, a facility you called it? A facility?\nZAN:\nUh, yeah.\nLILI:\nUm, okay. So what we know about the facilities is that it's a place where people who, uh, I guess fit into their definition of \"Sapiens\" live, and kind of like, make their own little community. That's kind of like separate from everybody else. I know that they don't like where-- \"you\" don't like-- I have heard that they don't like magic very much or at all. And that sometimes when... um... When people, you know, kind of manifest in their gifts, magically speaking, um, then they get kicked out of those communities. And, uh, um, yeah.\nOliver:\nShe looks very sad as she's telling you this.\nZAN:\nBut, they gave this to us. They were doing tests. They checked to make sure that it all worked. That.... there was nobody else there.\nLILI:\nOh, no, They just left you out there all on your own.\nZAN:\nI don't know! We don't--- we don't know anything.\nLILI:\nOh, I'm so sorry, dear. Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.\nOliver:\nAnd she kind of, like, moves towards you and bundles you up in a hug.\nZAN:\nOh, no, it's [smothered] OK.\nOliver:\nIt's very soft. Her big bosoms are pressed into your face.\nZAN:\n[Smothered and gay panic sarcasm] Oh, this is great.\nOliver:\nThen she sits back and kind of smooths your hair down.\nLILI:\nPoor thing. Poor poor thing.\nTalia:\nZan looks more like Hat at this moment that any other moment. Like a startled rodent.\nLILI:\nOh, stew!\nOliver:\nAnd then she gets up and leaves the room.\nAllison:\nErica looks over a Jasmin and says,\nERICA:\nDo you still have that black box that CASTR is in? Maybe they have seen something like that before.\nJASMIN:\n[Whispering] I-- I don't know that that's a very good idea. They don't see the, like the, uh, Sapiens very much? I mean, I think I'd kind of like to keep it for ourselves for now.\nERICA:\nOkay, that's fair.\nOliver:\nLili bustles back into the room and her arms are just like overflowing with, like, these little dishes of various foods. And she starts setting them out on this coffee table that they have. And there's some chips and some kind of paste thing and some little shiny green orbs. They look a little bit like grapes, but they're too big. She starts like, pushing them towards you. And she's like,\nLILI:\nEat, eat! You're probably hungry from all the walking.\nOliver:\nAnd then she hooks a big cauldron into the fireplace full of stew. Or, like, wet stew ingredients.\nAlan:\nCody starts stuffing his face with whatever's brightest on the table.\n[Laughter]\nAlan:\nWhatever looks this sweetest. And while he's doing so, he's like,\nCODY:\nOh, right. So you said you lived here for a long time, right?\nLILI:\nYes. Oh, we've lived here for 42 years now, that's just, uh, two years longer than we've been married, and yeah. I just love it out here in nature so we moved here. Mostly, um, to just find more plants, cause I like finding plants. And Nula likes growing plants. Um, yeah.\nCODY:\n[Swallows food]\nAlan:\nHe swallows real big, whatever it was he was chewing.\nTalia:\nSome good ASMR.\nCODY:\nUh, well, we're, we're following a trail, and it kind of came here and seems to run past... Um... Well, do you know who left that?\nLILI:\nYes. Oh, that was, um uh, What did he call himself, Nula?\nOliver:\nAnd she looks at Nula, Nula looks at her and Lili's like,\nLILI:\nOh, yes, The Hunter. He called himself The Hunter. Um, uses, like, very just like I don't know. Uh, earthy man. Yeah, I would say earthy. Um, and he came through here. He had one of those, uh, gray drab outfit things that Erica here was wearing -- that I promise I will get that cleaned up just as soon as I make sure everyone has had snacks -- Um, and yeah, he said he was leaving a trail in case other people like him came through. Oh, you must be the people that he was talking about! The people like him! Oh, and you've followed his trail. Oh, he'll be so happy. I hope you find him.\nCODY:\nWell, I tried to climb a tree and I got really high.\nLILI:\nOkay!\nCODY:\nBut I couldn't see exactly where it where the trail went. Do you know where he was going?\nLILI:\nWhat kind of tree? I love trees. Which tree did you climb?\nCODY:\nIt was blue.\nOliver:\nAnd her face just falls. And she's like,\nLILI:\nDid you touch it? The blue pine? Was it very tall and very shiny?\nCODY:\nUh, yeah? Yeah, it was next to the berries.\nLILI:\nNo. Oh, no. Oh, no. Code red, everybody! Code red!\nZAN:\nWhat?\nOliver:\nAnd she runs off into another room and you hear a bunch of clattering and smashing and she comes back and she's holding like, three glass vials. And she's like,\nLILI:\nNo, not this one. Um, no, not this one. Uh, yes, this one here!\nOliver:\nAnd she pulls a teaspoon of her apron and she pours a little bit in, and she's like,\nLILI:\nOpen up! Open up!\nZAN:\nWhat is-- what is that? What?\nLILI:\nUh, just a little something. Did any of you touch it?\nOliver:\nAnd she, like, looks at each of you, like in the eye. Did you touch the blue pine?\nZAN:\nNo.\nERICA:\nNo, no. Definitely did not.\nJASMIN:\nNo, no, no. I was a mouse.\nMAX:\nNo?\nLILI:\nOkay, great. Here. Open up, sweetheart.\nOliver:\nUh, Cody, do you open your mouth at all?\nCODY:\nUh um-- um, um!\nOliver:\nYeah, as you say \"um\" and open your mouth she puts she puts the spoonful of liquid in there. It's bitter, and it burns for a second and then you swallow it.\nCODY:\nBlegh!\nZAN:\nWhat?\nLILI:\n[Relaxing.] Okay, um, all right, let me see your hands.\nOliver:\nAnd she, like, takes your hands and you notice that your hands had a kind of shiny blue tint to them.\nZAN:\nWhaaaat.\nOliver:\nAnd as she holds them, and she's like,\nLILI:\nOkay, okay. I think we got in time.\nOliver:\nAnd as you watch, they turn back into your normal, sweaty kid palm color. She's like,\nLILI:\nOh-kayyy. That was fun for everybody.\nZAN:\nWhat. What was--\nCODY:\nI don't mean to be rude, but... what the heck?\n[Laughter]\nLILI:\nOh.\nOliver:\nShe she kind of like, holds your two hands in hers, and she looks you in the eye and she says,\nLILI:\nBlue pines are very toxic. Okay? Don't touch them. They're poisonous. Okay?\nCODY:\nOkay.\nLILI:\nI know they're very shiny, but don't touch them.\nJASMIN:\nWhat about silver feathers?\nLILI:\nOh, did you get one?\nJASMIN:\n...Yes? No? Uh, would it be bad if yes?\nZAN:\nWe have a feather now.\nLILI:\nNo, I'm not mad. Those are, actually quite rare and very hard to come by. Those are griffin feathers. Um, do you have griffins where you're from?\nZAN:\nNo.\nJASMIN:\nNo, we just-- We just have the regular birds and cats that are not combined.\nLILI:\n[Thoughtful] Cats. Cats. I have never heard of a cat.\nJASMIN:\nThey're very cute.\nZAN:\nOh, God. Why does-- this world don't have cats? That sucks!\n[Laughter]\nLILI:\nUm, yes. So they're, uh, they're, like, half bird on the front is the best way I can describe it. Beautiful silver feathers.\nJASMIN:\nAnd then cat on the back?\nLILI:\nNo, they're goblin on the back.\nZAN:\nThey're WHAT?\nLILI:\nThey're goblin on the back. Like-- like some sort of, like, very regal. Uh, silver-- I'm not good with the birds, okay? I'm good at, like all of the plants and most of the animals, but with the birds, I just-- they're so high, and they go so fast! Anyway, um. Yeah, it's like bird on the front and then goblin on the back. Like a big goblin, not like a little one. We have a little goblin.\nJASMIN:\nCan I see your little goblin?\nLILI:\nI don't know where he went. Teacup! Teacup! Pss pss pss pss pss. Teacup, come here.\nOliver:\nAnd you hear a \"meow\" from upstairs and Lili kind of like, trots up this very narrow little staircase, and then she comes back, and she has a big, fluffy cat in her arms.\nJASMIN:\n[Gasps.]\nOliver:\nShe's like,\nLILI:\nThis is Teacup. He's our goblin. He's a little sweetie, a little rascal too, aren't you? Aren't you?\nOliver:\nAnd she, like, kind of, like, moves her fingers in his face and he playfully bites at them.\nJASMIN:\nAw! That's what we call a cat.\nLILI:\nOh, isn't that darling? Oh, yeah. He's our little goblin.\nJASMIN:\nI love goblins.\nZAN:\nDoes he eat rats?\nLILI:\nUm, I don't know what that is. Is that a bird?\nJASMIN:\nOh, I can-- I can show you what a rat is--\nZAN:\nIt's, well, I could also show you what a rat is.\nJASMIN:\nOh, right.\nZAN:\nOne of them might be easier than the other one.\nRobot:\n[Laughing] You just wild shape into a rat again.\nAlice:\nDepends on how quickly Zan says her part.\nOliver:\nShe drops Teacup in your arms, Jasmin. And as the cat, like, rolls over, you can see that he has, like, clover on his back.\nAlice:\nLike actual clover?\nOliver:\nLike a bunch of just, like, vibrant green clover mixed in with his fur.\nZAN:\nHuh.\nLILI:\nYeah, Teacup, I think he's eaten a bug a couple times, but now just no, just lays out in the sun like most goblins.\nZAN:\nOkay.\nJASMIN:\nI love him so much.\nTalia:\nZan, like, sticks a hand over Hat, just in case.\nLILI:\nOh, who is this little guy?\nZAN:\nOh, that's Hat, she/her?\nOliver:\nShe goes like,\nLILI:\npss pss pss pss, [kissy noises]\nOliver:\nand holds out her hands for hat.\nZAN:\nOkay, uh, be careful.\nTalia:\nAnd I like scoop Hat off my shoulder and sort of put her in her hands.\nLILI:\nOh, what a sweet little thing, aren't you? Would you like a cookie?\nOliver:\nAnd she, like, takes one of the chips from the table and, like, offers it to Hat, who nibbles on it.\nLILI:\nOh, what a little sweetheart. And her name is Hat?\nZAN:\nYeah, it's a nickname.\nLILI:\nThat's lovely. Oh, isn't she, darling?\nOliver:\nAnd she kind of, like, puts her back in your hands.\nJASMIN:\nUm uh, Lili? You said your name was?\nLILI:\nYes.\nAlice:\nUh, Jasmin looks with just complete adoration at the goblin, and that looks back up at Lili.\nJASMIN:\nUm, can we maybe stay here for the night? If I can-- if I can...\nLILI:\nOh, yes, of course. Of course, of course!\nJASMIN:\nBecause I can apparently turn into animals. And I would love nothing more in my life than to be able to turn into a goblin.\nOliver:\nWindred bursts into the room and says,\nWINDRED:\nYou can what?!\nOliver:\nAnd Lili is also in shock. And Nula, for the first time, is like,\nNULA:\nSorry. You can what?\nCODY:\nShe's an Animorph.\nNULA:\nOh, no.\nOliver:\nAnd Lili has her hands over her mouth, and is like,\nLILI:\nOh, sweetheart. Oh, no wonder they kicked you out and left you in the woods.\nJASMIN:\nHuh?\nLILI:\nOh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Um oh, no.\nOliver:\nAnd Windred stomps over to you and looks Jasmin the eye, and she's like,\nWINDRED:\nDo you have your shit under control?\nJASMIN:\nDo-- what? What? I'm sorry--\nWINDRED:\nBecause we can't-- I can't have you in my house if you're just going to turn into some bugbear and punch through the walls and all of my--\nJASMIN:\nI don't know what a bugbear is?\nOliver:\nAnd they like, look at the rest of you, and are suddenly very on edge.\nZAN:\nHey, would you calm down? Like, it's fine. I don't even think she can do it again today.\nWINDRED:\nYou better not.\nJASMIN:\nUhh---\nZAN:\nIt's not even-- like-- it's like we've got, like, buttons that we push to do these things!\nTalia:\nZan clicks her wrists together and shows off the screen.\nOliver:\nWindred just kind of like, rubs her temples and then, like, glares at Jasmin.\nJASMIN:\nI'm sorry!\nOliver:\nAnd then backs out of the room into the kitchen. And, like, closes the door is like,\nWINDRED:\nDon't kill anybody!\nZAN:\nShe's not gonna kill anybody! Why are you-- ugh.\nCODY:\nJasmin's the nicest person in our group. She wouldn't hurt anybody.\nOliver:\nLili looks at Nula, and Nula, sighs and puts down her tea and comes over and sits on the coffee table in front of you, Jasmin. And she says,\nNULA:\nYou probably don't know very much about all of your powers.\nJASMIN:\nUm.\nNULA:\nI don't know what this device is, that they've got around your wrists, and if that's helping your magic or stopping it...\nJASMIN:\nIt prevents us from becoming juice.\nNULA:\nOh, um. May I?\nOliver:\nShe, like, reaches towards your wristband.\nJASMIN:\nOh, OK?\nOliver:\nYeah, she very gently just turns your wrist over and looks at it and turns it the other way. Then she puts one hand on your wristband and her eyes glow pink for a second. And then she lets go and blinks and looks at you. And she says,\nNULA:\nI think this will keep it under control. Hmm. So. A long time ago, things were different than they are now. I don't know very much, um, you might be able to find a historian who can give you the full, accurate, low down. Most of what people know is passed on through stories and legends. But a long time ago, when magic first hit us, it changed people. And some of those people, when they changed, they didn't make it. Most of them, even.\n{1:27:43}\nNULA:\nAnd some people changed only a little bit and ended up with magic and with these powers, and some people didn't change it all. And for the most part, the only places you'll find people who are completely unchanged and \"dull\"-- Sorry, that's what we call people without magic. They live in these little Sapien enclaves, and they're very protective about those places. I'm guessing that's where you came from. And they did something to you that you can't remember... which is horrible. But... people that can change into animals are very feared out here. Okay?\nOliver:\nAnd she's, like, very earnestly looking you in the eyes and, like, is waiting for you to acknowledge what she said.\nJASMIN:\nUm... okay.\nNULA:\nI know that this is all very confusing and very overwhelming. But if you let someone see you turn into a creature, they might kill you. They'll probably lock you away. Do you understand?\nJASMIN:\nYes.\nNULA:\nOK.\nJASMIN:\nSo I... I can't turn into a goblin?\nOliver:\nAnd she smiles and she looks down at Teacup who is purring contentedly in your arms and she says,\nNULA:\nI know it's alluring to want to, but you need to be very, very careful. There are other people like you out there, somewhere. I met one once. But you can find them, and they can tell you a lot more than we can.\nOliver:\nAnd then she stands up when she kind of, uh, smooths down her tunic and looks at all of you and says,\nNULA:\nThat was quite a lot for one day. Um, why don't we... Why don't we eat some stew and we can show you the garden and kind of have a nice... Have a nice afternoon. While this all settles in.\nJASMIN:\nI am just going to... eat outside, if that's OK. Um. Yeah.\nNULA:\nOh, I'll come with you.\nOliver:\nAnd she goes over to the stew, which is simmering at this point. It smells delicious. And scoops out two bowls and then kind of nods to Jasmin.\nNULA:\nCome on. Let's go outside.\nAlan:\nAs Jasmine goes to leave, Cody just grabs a hand or shirt sleeves or whatever he'd grab.\nCODY:\nJasmin?\nJASMIN:\nYes, Cody?\nCODY:\nI'm not scared of you.\nJASMIN:\nUm.
