You\u2019re face-down, with a cheek pressed to the large, smooth tiles, your limbs flung out haphazardly as though you were unceremoniously dumped here. A soreness creeps over your body as the grogginess of sleep fades, the kind of soreness that comes from a long, deep sleep. Longer than you intended. This is not where you went to bed last night. As far as you can remember, on December 1st, 2019, you crawled into your own bed, same as always. Things were normal. And now, they most certainly are not. What do you do?\n=== INTRO THEME: \u201cElysia\u201d by People Need Goals ===\n\n\n\n\n{1:15}\nTalia: Could we\u2014could I look around?\nOliver: Yes, you can definitely look around! So as you look around, you see more of the same large, white tiles. They cover the floor of this square room, as well as the walls, and as you crane your neck upward you see that the ceiling is the same. Each tile gives off a soft, white glow, and together they light up the room. There are no windows in this room. On one wall is a square, metal door, ringed in blue light. It looks like an airlock from a generic sci-fi movie. There\u2019s no handle, and a diagonal line down the center where you assume it will part to let you through.\nOliver: There are, however, three other people strewn about, all waking up in various states of confusion.\nOliver: So, to the four of you, I\u2019m going to say that you\u2019re probably looking around at this point, and could you each give a quick description of what the other characters see when they look at you? And I will start with\u2026 Jasmin.\n{2:18}\nAlice: You see a tall and painfully thin woman with tan skin and very long silky black hair. She has deep bags under her eyes and in general her eyes seem to be darting around as if in a bit of a panic. She\u2019s probably sat up by now and is holding her hands around her chest, shaking slightly.\nOliver: And this person is wearing a grey jumpsuit, like grey coveralls, and a pair of generic white sneakers. And as your character looks down, you see you\u2019re also wearing that same outfit. Why don\u2019t we have Max go next?\n{3:06}\nRobot: So you see this fairly tall, sort-of good-looking guy who\u2019s probably in his early twenties, pretty clean shaven, and looks like he lifted quite a few heavy things in his life.\nOliver: Good, good! Zan?\n{3:25}\nTalia: You see a pretty short young woman, about mid-to-late twenties, with short black hair that\u2019s shaven on the sides and back. She\u2019s pretty thin and scrawny-looking, looks like she might get mistaken for a middle schooler sometimes and be really grumpy about it.\n[Oliver laughs]\nTalia: And her brows are knit together as she takes in her surroundings. She\u2019s frowning and looking like she\u2019s getting kind of agitated, but with a really hardcore resting bitch face.\nOliver: Good! Okay. And then our last person is Cody.\n{4:07}\nAlan: You see a young boy whose eyes are darting around the room, carefully taking in everything but also avoiding direct eye contact as much as possible. He seems\u2026 okay with where he\u2019s at, but, you know, just curious. He\u2019s just your standard kid, squarely in his preteen years, but with a full head of dirty blonde hair shaped into a gloriously shiny and perfectly round bowlcut.\n[Talia laughs]\nRobot: Yes!\nAlice: Amazing!\nOliver: Good. So we got two tall people and two maybe middle schoolers, but one is not.\n[Everyone laughs]\nOliver: Okay, before you can do anything else, you hear a gentle chime, ding-ding, and then a voice.\nINTERCOM: WELCOME TO THE TRIAL. PLEASE PROCEED TO TESTING CHAMBER B FOR CALIBRATION.\n{5:03}\nOliver: And you notice that the door, that weird square metal door has a glowing letter B above it. What do you do?\nZAN: Oh, oh heck no!\nAlice: I scramble to my feet and I take a few gingerly steps backwards, kind-of like, feeling with my hands behind me, until I hit a wall and then almost like hugging the wall to see if it\u2019s real, looking around to see where the voice came from.\nOliver: Yeah, you can roll a perception to try to see if you can find it.\nAlice: Sure.\nOliver: [singing] We\u2019re playing Dungeons and Dragons!\n[Dice roll]\nAlice: That would be a 2 + 4, 6.\nOliver: You have no fucking idea where that noise came from! It could be in your pants.\n[Everyone laughs]\nOliver: It could be the ceiling. It could\u2019ve been one of the people in the room! No clue. Zero clue.\nAlice: Yeah\u2026 so the eyes that were already darting around, the rest of the head is now also darting around.\nAlan: Cody is, uh, is kind of like--he was taken aback by the sudden movement and is now stuck, trying to look back and forth between everyone in the room, trying to figure out if he should also be panicked.\nTalia: Zan stands up and looks down at her overalls and sort of brushes them off a little bit as she examines them and looks around at the other people in the room and says,\nZAN: Okay, so, I don\u2019t know who any of you guys are, and I don\u2019t know where I am? But that door seems to be the only direction to go. So\u2026 rather than continue petting the tiles of these walls, I\u2019m thinking maybe we go up to it? Any thoughts?\n[Silence.]\nZAN: Okay\u2026\n[Oliver laughs]\n{6:57}\nJASMIN: I, uh, what\u2026 English?\nZAN: Yes! Oh, uh, that\u2019s never a problem in video games.\nJASMIN: Okay, no, I speak English.\nZAN: Cool!\nJASMIN: Who are you?\nZAN: What?\nJASMIN: Who are you?\nZAN: Oh, uh, I\u2019m Zan. Zan Kuo. Nice to meet you? I guess? This seems kind of like an inopportune time for... anything? Who are you?\nJASMIN: Jasmin, uh, Jasmin Seller.\nZAN: And y\u2019all other people?\nMAX: Uh, hi. I\u2019m Max. So\u2026 so none of you went to sleep here last night, right? This is definitely not where I went to sleep.\nZAN: I definitely would not have been able to fall asleep on this floor.\nJASMIN: Unless someone broke in and drastically changed my house.\n[Zan laughs]\nAlan: Cody slowly raises his hand.\nZAN: Oh, did you go to sleep here last night?\n[Oliver laughs]\nCODY: Oh! No\u2014\nZAN: Are you asking permission? You have a question?\nCODY: No, I just\u2014I\u2019m Cody?\nZAN: Oh.\nMAX: Oh, hi Cody.\nCODY: Uh\u2026 hi.\nMAX: So, door I guess?\nINTERCOM: PLEASE PROCEED TO TESTING CHAMBER B.\nMAX: Door, then.\nZAN: Door works for me.\nJASMIN: Oh, okay.\nRobot: Max is going to get up and go walk over to the door, see if there\u2019s any kind of way to open it.\nOliver: As you approach the door, it just slides open, seems like some sort of automatic door, revealing a small space and another identical door about six feet beyond it ringed in red light.\nZAN: Oh great, just doors all the way down.\nOliver: Do you go in there?\nRobot: Yeah, I\u2019ll walk in.\nTalia: I\u2019m following close behind.\nOliver: Okay, so Zan and Max are in there.\nAlan: Once two people have left, Cody feels cool following most of the crowd.\nAlice: Jasmin takes a second and takes a very deep breath, then opens her eyes and realizes she\u2019s been left behind and just scrambles after the rest, trying to make it before the door closes and she\u2019s left alone.\nOliver: You easily make it in there, and once the four of you are inside this little space, the door behind you shuts and changes to red.\nAlice: Jasmin yelps in surprise.\nOliver: Then the second door changes to blue and opens. And through the doorway you can see a long narrow hallway. The hall is made of those same glowing white tiles, and at the far end of the hallway is another airlock. Above it is the letter C.\nINTERCOM: PLEASE PROCEED TO TESTING CHAMBER C.\nZAN: Wait, was that\u2014\nOliver: What do you do?\nZAN: Was that Testing Chamber B? Did we do it?\nMAX: Did we need to do anything?\nZAN: Did we win?\nMAX: Wow, this is an easy game.\nJASMIN: Maybe they\u2019re testing doors?\n[Oliver laughs]\nJASMIN: Is this like a door factory? Maybe they\u2019re testing doors.\nZAN: Seems like a pretty roundabout way to test doors.\nJASMIN: Probably illegal. This is illegal, right? Like, I don\u2019t think you can kidnap people to test doors.\nZAN: I don\u2019t know, maybe there\u2019s a weird door testing loophole somewhere. I say we walk down the hallway.\nMAX: I\u2019m in.\nTalia: Zan walks down the hallway.\nAlan: Cody follows.\nOliver: Okay, so Zan starts walking down the hallway and she\u2019s in front. About halfway down the hallway, Zan, you step on a tile and feel it sink an inch into the floor, and there\u2019s an audible click.\nZAN: Aw, tits.\nOliver: And I\u2019ll give you a reaction here, what do you do?\nTalia: I\u2019m just gonna crouch down real low but not take my weight off the tile.\nOliver: Okay, so you see Zan just suddenly stop and crouch, and the wall tile nexts to you grinds forward, tilting away from the wall. You hear this awful screech as it slowly pushes towards you and then stops. It was once some sort of spring-loaded trap that was going to crush you into the opposite wall. Instead, it gets stuck halfway and stays there, a few sparks shoot out from the exposed mechanical arm that was pushing it forward.\n{11:20}\nINTERCOM: OH NO, THIS TEST IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL. PLEASE PROCEED TO TESTING CHAMBER C.\nAlan: Cody goes over to look at the broken mechanism.\nOliver: Ooh, okay. [Laughs] I\u2019m picturing Zan still just crouched next to this tile that was about to crush her.\nTalia: Yeah, I\u2019m just gonna take a second down here, check my feet.\nOliver: Check out your cool shoes. Cody, can you make an investigation check for me?\nAlan: Okay. [Dice rolls] Natural 20.\n[Everyone oohs]\nOliver: Cody, you peek in the space between this title and the wall. The tiles are pretty big, they\u2019re like two feet by four feet, and so you look back there and this mechanical arm that is connecting the tile to the back wall is connecting it to another metal wall with a bunch of cables and dust back there. And you, with your natural 20, see that there is a wrench jammed into a place where two of the levers would grind against each other, effectively stopping the trap where it is. Also, I guess with this natural 20, you can see that this wrench is pretty dirty and maybe has some red-colored stuff on it.\nAlan: Okay, so Cody looks back at everyone in the room, figures out that Zan probably can\u2019t move. Cody\u2019s played enough video games, he knows how this works.\nOliver: I would say that Zan has enough space to get out, she could wiggle out.\nTalia: Yeah.\nAlan: Okay.\nOliver: She hasn\u2019t been crushed. [Alice laughs]\nTalia: I feel like it\u2019s either a pressure sensitive \u201cyou gotta stay on it,\u201d or it\u2019s like a \u201cyou gotta jump outta the way,\u201d and I clearly chose the wrong one. [Oliver and Robot laugh] We\u2019re fine.\nAlan: Okay, well Cody looks at anyone who looks like they\u2019re willing to move and gestures with his hand, trying to get their attention to come see what they\u2019re looking at.\nOliver: I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s going to be Max.\nRobot: I\u2019ll go over, yeah.\nOliver: Okay, so Max, you look in there and Cody points out this wrench\u2014it\u2019s like, jammed in and has stopped the trap from going.\nMAX: What am I looking at?\nOliver: Cody\u2019s like \u201cHey cool wrench, right?\u201d\nAlan: Yeah!\nTalia: From the ground you hear Zan say--\nZAN: Wait, I wanna see the cool wrench!\nMAX: Do you want it? Do you want me to pull it out, or\u2026?\nAlan: Cody just looks and is like--\nCODY: Uhh\u2026 just\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to pull it out and make things worse, but maybe it\u2019s useful? I don\u2019t know.\nTalia: I feel like I wanna move out of the way of this thing in case pulling the wrench out completes this action.\nAlice: Yes, please move!\n{14:12}\nRobot: As soon as Cody\u2019s sentence is done, Max just reaches in and yanks on it.\nOliver: [laughs] And yanks on it? Okay, great. Max, you make a strength check which I know you\u2019re gonna beat, and Zan, you make a dexterity check to try to jump out of the way.\nTalia: Okay, cool.\nRobot: 16 + 2. 18.\nOliver: Okay, great, you rip that wrench right out of there.\nTalia: Uh, I got a 6?\nOliver: [sighs] Oh boy, okay. Zan, you take 3 points of bludgeoning damage as the tile slams forward the rest of the way and whaps you into the opposite wall. It seems like it\u2019s still pretty broken, like you are not crushed and dead, but that hurt. You just took it straight on the shoulder. But on the other hand, Max now has a cool wrench.\nZAN: Well I\u2019m so glad I could help you with your new wrench collection. Maybe some warning next time would be cool.\nJASMIN: Are you okay?\nZAN: I mean, I\u2019m like\u2014\nINTERCOM: PLEASE PROCEED TO TESTING CHAMBER C.\nZAN: I\u2019m fine.\nAlan: Cody runs over to Zan and tries to help her up. He just wants to know she\u2019s okay.\nTalia: Zan stands up and brushes herself off and tries to look tough.\nOliver: Cool, great. I think Max, Cody, and Jasmin are still on the other side of this stuck-out arm thing, but you can easily get around it if you want to follow Zan down the hallway.\nAlan: Cody is now officially stuck to Zan, new best friend.\nOliver: Okay, great!\nTalia: New small friends. It\u2019s the short squad.\nAlice: I will try to get over or under the arm to get to the other side.\nOliver: Yeah, this one\u2019s not even hard enough you need a check, you easily get to the other side. And when you get to the next door, this door marked C, it slides open and you see again a small space with another door six feet away.\nZAN: I feel like we should get some credit for fixing this test for them.\nJASMIN: Do you think they\u2019re all like that? Are they going to keep getting more dangerous?\nZAN: I mean, I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re all like that in that they\u2019re all broken, but um\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not how this is gonna work.\n{16:42}\nOliver: So once you\u2019re all in this airlock section, the door behind you shuts, turns red, and the one in front of you turns blue and opens. You see Testing Chamber C. This testing chamber is another big square room, same as the one you woke up in, except it has two major differences. One, it has another airlock door on the opposite wall. The second is that it has a giant pit across the center of the room. The pit is about 20 feet across, and then you hear that chime again.\nINTERCOM: PLEASE PROCEED TO TESTING CHAMBER D.\nOliver: And you see the other door has a little D above it. What do you do?\nJASMIN: Um, how? Excuse me? How?\nOliver: Yeah, you don\u2019t hear any answer.\nZAN: Well it was, uh, worth a shot.\nTalia: I slowly look over the edge of the pit.\nOliver: Okay, make an intelligence check. Or actually a wisdom check.\nTalia: Wisdom check, wisdom wisdom wisdom\u2026 [dice rolls] uh, that\u2019s a 15?\nOliver: 15, okay. With your 15, you\u2019d say the pit is 60 feet deep, but you can see along one of the sides, there\u2019s a ledge that\u2019s maybe a foot wide that you could use to cross to the other side. The pit is just straight rectangle tiles all the way down, and then at the bottom just flat tiles.\nTalia: Okay.\nOliver: With your wisdom you know it would hurt a lot to jump in that pit.\nTalia: Yeah, cool. I very slowly start making my way towards the path around the side.\nOliver: Okay, nice.\nTalia: I do a \u201ccome on\u201d gesture.\nOliver: Does anyone go with Zan\u2019s cool plan?\nAlan: Cody is right with her. He\u2019s right there, he trusts Zan.\nRobot: Yeah, Max is gonna go too.\nOliver: Alright, cool. Jasmin, do you hang out and see how they do, or\u2026?\nAlice: Jasmin just looks on nervously\u2014\nOliver: Just watches them?\nAlice: Yes.\nOliver: Maybe gives a nod? \u201cGoodbye, have fun with your pit\u2014\u201d\nAlice: No! [laughs] Quite the opposite of that, actually. She looks really nervous that the rest of them are going.\nOliver: Yes. Okay, cool. So the three of you get to this little ledge, it looks pretty solid, and I\u2019m guessing you start creeping your way across?\nTalia: I give it a little tap with my foot first.\nOliver: Okay, yeah. You give the tiles a tap on the ledge and they\u2019re solid. Looks fine.\nTalia: Okay, so I start making my way, slowly, across.\nOliver: Okay, cool. So for each of you that are doing that, I\u2019m gonna say do an Acrobatics check?\n[dice rolls]\nTalia: Oofa doofa\u2026 9 for Zan.\nOliver: Okay.\nRobot: Uh\u2026 mine was 0, so 3.\nOliver: Oh shit, okay!\nAlan: Also a 3 for Cody.\nOliver: [strained] Jesus Christ, guys!\nRobot: Yikes.\nTalia: We\u2019re all gonna start rolling some new characters, huh?\n[Alan laughs]\nOliver: Okay, um\u2014\nAlice: I\u2019m feeling better about my decision.\n[Everyone laughs]\nOliver: I\u2019d like to see\u2014Jasmin says that in real time, just like \u201cOh, that\u2019s what you get.\u201d Okay, as the three of you are creeping your way along this ledge, I\u2019m gonna say that Cody slips and one foot goes right off the edge. And since Max was following right behind him, he bumps into Cody and the two of you are about to fall right off and into the pit. I\u2019ll give you a reaction. What are you gonna try and do to not die?\nAlan: Uh\u2026\nRobot: Uh\u2026 I\u2019m just gonna push Cody back toward the wall.\nOliver: Oh, okay.\nAlice: Can I try and catch Cody if they\u2019re still close enough to my side?\nOliver: I\u2019m gonna say they\u2019re not close enough, they\u2019re like halfway across at the point.\nTalia: Can I try to grab on?\nOliver: Yeah, so why don\u2019t\u2014\nAlan: I think instinctively Cody would reach for the closest human, and I think that\u2019s Zan?\nOliver: Yes, because Zan would be in front of you. So why don\u2019t all three of you roll a straight dexterity check and we\u2019ll see if any of you survive this.\n[Dice rolls]\nTalia: Gonna get a new dice\u2026\n[Alan sighs]\nTalia: Oddly enough, that\u2019s another 9.\nOliver: Okay, great!\nAlan: That\u2019s an 8 for Cody. [laughs]\nOliver: 8 for Cody\u2026 Max, what\u2019d you get?\nRobot: This dice is going straight to jail because I got a 4.\n[Everyone laughs]\nOliver: You got a 4. Okay, so the way I\u2019m going to resolve this is that Max was trying to push Cody back, Cody was trying to grab on Zan, Zan was trying to grab onto Cody. You all fucked it up real bad. [Everyone laughs] I\u2019m gonna say that Max, you just whiff and instead of pushing Cody back, you manage to topple onto the ledge, and you stay on the ledge. But you send poor little twelve-year-old Cody just right off.\nTalia: Oh no!\nOliver: I imagine the three adults are just losing their fucking minds and watching Cody, with his little bowlcut, tumble off the ledge into a pit.\n[Robot laughs]\nOliver: You see this light. You can see it come right out of Cody and surround him. And suddenly what feels like slow motion of him tumbling off the edge becomes actual slow motion. And the two of you from this ledge--Max, I guess now on his stomach, and Zan, probably got elbowed somewhere in there, clinging onto the wall--you watch as Cody floats slowly downwards, like a couple feet. And then a couple more feet. And then a couple more feet. And he is in no danger at all now. He\u2019s just floating down like he\u2019s attached to some balloons.\nZAN: Oh, shit. Ah, shoot. Uh\u2026\nMAX: Uh\u2026\nZAN: That normal?\nMAX: Uh, were we supposed to do that?\nOliver: And then you hear that chime again.\nINTERCOM: CONGRATULATIONS. YOUR EXPOSURE TO THE SYMPATHETIC PARALLEL ENERGY HAS MANIFESTED INTO ABILITIES CONGRUENT WITH THE WIZARD DESIGNATION. YOU MAY NOW ACCESS THE MAIN MENU OF YOUR SYMPATHETIC PARALLEL ENERGY LIAISON. TOUCH YOUR PROPRIETARY SBEL PROTOTYPE WRISTBANDS TOGETHER TO ACCESS THE MAIN MENU.\nOliver: So Cody\u2019s powers have manifested, he\u2019s just slowly floating down into the pit, and is Cody just speechless during all of this?\nAlan: Uh, yes. Cody is just along for the ride, quite literally, but also mentally at this point. It\u2019s a little bit overwhelming, and nothing quite makes sense.\nOliver: [laughs] To be floating?\nAlan: Yeah, nothing makes sense. And his little twelve-year-old mind, who, you know, doesn\u2019t have much agency in his day-to-day life anyway, is just kind of living in that zone. Like \u201cWell, this is what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nOliver: Perfect.\nZAN: Did that voice say \u201cwizard?\u201d Like Harry Potter wizard?\nJASMIN: Is he okay?\nOliver: Yeah. At this point, Cody has floated down to the bottom of the pit and as soon as your little sneakers touch the tiles, you hear a rumbling noise. The floor underneath you shakes a little as the entire bottom of the pit starts rising back up like an elevator. And it pushes you up and up and up until you\u2019re all now standing on a square, white floor. No more pit, it\u2019s gone. You\u2019re all together.\n{25:06}\nAlan: The moment that Cody can, that he feels comfortable, he's gonna run over to the whole group and just kind of get as close as he can, and he just looks up and goes,\nCODY: Um so, like, I'm\u2014can we be friends?\n[Oliver laughs]\nCODY: I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, but, uh, I'm beginning to think this is, like, not a dream or something, and I really, I want I want some friends that I could talk to.\nMAX: Uh, yeah, sure kid. I\u2019ll be your friend.\nJASMIN: If you want to be?\nZAN: Well, looks like you got two friends, don\u2019t need me...\nJASMIN: Oh come on, he really likes you.\nZAN: Ah, fine, yeah. We\u2019re\u2026 friends.\nCODY: Well hi, I\u2019m Cody, and I\u2019m 12, and, uh, I don\u2019t know where I am and have any of y\u2019all seen my backpack?\nJASMIN: Oh great, he\u2019s 12.\nOliver: That\u2019s a baby!\nTalia: I don\u2019t remember 12 being a great age, so this might actually be a step up from middle school?\nAlan: It\u2019s 7th grade, squarely in 7th grade.\n[Robot laughs]\nZAN: Well, I\u2019m glad we know what to do with pits now. I vote that guy be the one to jump in next time, and uh\u2026 shall we?\nCODY: I would rather not be thrown into pits, but I mean\u2026 I guess I can kind of fly Buzz Lightyear style now?\nZAN: Oh no no no no, not you kid. No, you did the jump\u2014you fell, but, you know, you did the falling. No, somebody else can do it next time.\nCODY: Oh, okay, well\u2026 I hope y\u2019all can fly.\nMAX: Well, if we all get to fly, then I guess I\u2019ll volunteer.\n[Oliver laughs]\nZAN: Great! Only one way to find out.\nJASMIN: No thank you. Are we sure it\u2019s safe now? It\u2019s not gonna turn back into a pit or anything?\nZAN: I don\u2019t know, better walk over it fast, I guess.\nTalia: Zan starts walking towards the other door.\nAlice: Jasmin very carefully goes to where the ledge originally was and is going to very gingerly and slowly walk over it.\nOliver: Beautiful. [laughs] I won\u2019t make you roll anything, there\u2019s no consequences if you don\u2019t do it good.\nAlan: Cody now has friends and magic powers, he is feeling so great and he is there with them 100%.\nOliver: Awesome! Okay, so to clarify some things. So each of you is wearing plain grey coveralls, and on each wrist\u2014you probably felt them at this point\u2014you have a metal shackle. It rings around your wrist, it\u2019s about two inches wide, and there\u2019s no clasp or anything to get it off. And then the announcement comes on again.\nINTERCOM: PLEASE PROCEED TO TESTING CHAMBER D.\nRobot: Uh, as we walk over to the door, Max is going to inspect this medical thing. Just a lot of touching, like this is an iWatch, he\u2019s trying every gesture he knows.\n[Talia laughs]\nOliver: Great! So you got one on each wrist, so I assume you picked one and started poking it.\nRobot: Uh-huh.\nOliver: Great, nothing happens. Do you want to do an investigation check to really look at it?\nRobot: Oh no, it\u2019s just a lot of poking and swiping.\n[crosstalk]\nOliver: Double tap, pinch to zoom.\nRobot: Zoom in and out.\nOliver: Perfect. Alright, nothing happens.\nJASMIN: Are you sure that's a great idea? What if it explodes or something?\nMAX: Uh\u2026\nAlan: Cody, having seen Max do that and also realizing that the voice said something about having access to something, decides he also wants to check his, since it did make him fly.\nOliver: Um, why don\u2019t you roll a wisdom check? I want to see if Cody understood the directions.\nAlan: Okay. [dice rolls] That\u2019d be an 11.\nOliver: Uh, no. You remember the voice saying to do something, but you don't remember what it was.\nAlan: Okay, yeah, I was falling at the time and panicked, so.\nOliver: Yes, valid.\nTalia: Zan seems to remember something about putting the bracelets together, so she sort of looks at her own bracelets and does a cool Wonder Woman across-the-chest thing to test it out.\nOliver: Cool. So Zan, when you touch your two wristbands together, a menu appears above your left wrist. It takes the form of slightly transparent floating screen filled with data. Your full name is there along with your age, your height, and your blood type. You also have a hit point counter showing your current and maximum hit point, and beneath that is a box that says Unknown Class Designation.\nTalia: Man, I don\u2019t even know my blood type.\nOliver: Well, there it is.\nTalia: Good to know.\nCODY: Whoa.\nRobot: When you say that Max looks up from, like, just furiously gesturing to this medical thing, and is like--\nMAX: Whoa, How'd you do that? What, which-- How\u2019d you touch it?\nZAN: You should-- the tappy-- you should touch you touch them together, I think.\nMAX: Oh, cool.\nRobot: And he'll he'll do it.\nOliver: Cool. Okay. So, Max, you you touch your wrist bands together. Same thing. Above your left wrist is this little screen, and it shows your full name, your age, your height, your blood type your hit points and then under that, it also says your class is unknown.\nTalia: Is it like a projection, or is it like a screen popped out of them?\nOliver: It's like a floating sci-fi screen. Like, if you put your hand through it, it'll just kind of go through it. It's like a little projection.\nAlice: Like a hologram.\nOliver: Yeah, like a hologram. There's a word for it. The floaty sci-fi guy.\nAlice: The floaty sci-fi shit. It's the technical term, I believe.\nTalia: Zan's gonna like, wave her hand through it and tried to dispel it or push it back down into the braclet.\nOliver: Yeah, as you actually do that motion of like, squishing it in. It does go into your bracelet and disappears.\nTalia: Oh, nice.\nAlan: Uh, this whole time, the moment Cody saw Zan do it, he has also put his together, and is just waving his hand around, trying to see if the hologram moves with his hand.\nOliver: It does move with his hand. Cody, though, along with all of your personal information, it does have a line that says \u201cClass Designation: Wizard.\u201d And then underneath that is a list. There are options like \u201cequip quarter staff\u201d and then \u201ccast light.\u201d And next to each of those spells is a level. At the top of the list it says Level one, there's two check boxes. One is already filled in. So on your character sheet, you can now see all of these extra things you can do.\n[crosstalk]\nOliver: I don't actually know if Cody looked at it or is still just fucking around.\nAlan: Yeah, he hasn't looked beyond, like, he just got it activated. And is just kind of like messing with the hologram trying to see, like can shake it off, like, he's just playing around the new toy. Basically.\nOliver: Great. Well, the rest of you can I think I see his screen from there and see that his has more stuff than yours does.\nAlice: I very explicitly do not do the thing.\nOliver: Great.\nAlice: I keep my wrists far apart.\nOliver: Just T-posing, one arm in each direction. Great.\nZAN: Hey, Jasmin, don't you wanna get in on the light show?\nJASMIN: No, thank you.\nZAN: Suit yourself.\nINTERCOM: Bing bong. Please proceed to testing chamber D. If you do not proceed to testing chamber D, you will be incentivized to do so.\nZAN: Well, that doesn't sound great.\nJASMIN: No, let's go. I don't want to be incentivized. It sounds unpleasant.\n=== START MIDROLL ===\nOliver: Welcome to the first episode of Dice Disasters. This is our home brew Dungeons and Dragons podcast. I'm your dungeon master, Oliver Northwood, my pronouns are they/them. I live in California but I am Canadian so sometimes they say words different than Americans. And here's the rest of the people. I don't know. This is hard.\nTalia: Hi!\nAlan: Hi! We\u2019re all here! Hello everyone!\nOliver: Everyone makes disturbed, nervous noises.\nAlan: Thank you for listening to our podcast, that we're making for you, and for us... mostly for us.\nAlice: Mostly for us.\nTalia: Hello.\nAlan: We're a bunch of anxiety filled people who want to make up stories with our friends and -- for some reason -- release it to the world.\nAlice: No, I actually think it's fun!\nAlan: Yes. It is.\nAlice: But, like, Oliver introduced themselves, so maybe we should introduce ourselves?\nTalia: No this is fine.\nOliver: Yeah this sounds about right.\nRobot: No, Oliver is the only person to ever introduce themselves.\nTalia: Hi, I'm Talia Dutton. My pronouns are she/her and I play Zan Kuo whose pronouns are also she/her. I live in Los Angeles, California and I'm a cartoonist, and I have hoarded dice for about three years now with absolutely no hope of playing dungeons and dragons because I don't have enough friends.\nAlan: And now you finally have a use for it! We made it a podcast for your dice.\nOliver: For the dice, yes.\nTalia: Yes, it's so good. Not for the friends. It\u2019s for the dice.\nOliver: The friends are an unfortunate side effect.\nTalia: We'll make do.\nRobot: Howdy, y\u2019all.\n[cast dissolves into screams and laughter]\n[crosstalk]\nRobot: Fuck yeah, I\u2019m keepin\u2019 it! I'm keeping the howdy and you can't stop me.\nAlice: Just... yes.\nOliver: That's it. That was his whole introduction.\nTalia: Howdy, y\u2019all, it\u2019s me, the howdy man.\nRobot: Howdy, y\u2019all I'm Robert Riley and--\n[crosstalk] \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\"\nOliver: I absolutely refuse to have that name exist. Your name is Robot.\nAlan: Yes.\nOliver: You have been always named Robot and forever named Robot.\nAlan: We've been playing games online for years and your name is Robot. That\u2019s what we always call you and I will refuse to call you ROb--ERT.\nOliver: When we first started, and I was was like, \u201cOh, I wanna have these people in my Dungeons and Dragons podcast,\u201d and I was like, \u201cWell... do I call him Robot or rAHWBert? And every time I said r-ROWBURT... I couldn\u2019t do it. I choked, and I was like this is my friend RrrrOBBHERT??\nRobot: Howdy y\u2019all. My name is... Robot, and my pronouns are he/him, and I play Max whose pronouns are also he/him. I live in Louisiana--\nOliver: In a swamp!\nRobot: --in a swamp and I ride and alligator to work every day.\nTalia: What's the alligator\u2019s name?\nAlice: What\u2019s his name?\nRobot: Um, Tim...othy.\nOliver: I heard \u201ctit.\u201d\n[crosstalk]\nAlan: This is my alligator, tit.\nAlice: TITmothy?? Titmothy the alligator.\n[laughter and crosstalk]\nAlice: I think it\u2019s my turn? Hi, I\u2019m Alice Jooren. I'm a character artist from the Netherlands. My pronouns are she and hers, and I play Jasmin those pronouns are also she and hers. I'm in about five D&D groups and I play a lot of it. Don't at me about this. But another thing is that I like a lot of other tabletop RPGs too. I've played pretty much all of the ones that I know about. And I'm always up for playing more.\nTalia: If she finds one, she plays it.\nAlice: Yeah.\nAlan: And we're very happy to have you because, uh, when we don't know what's up, you can help tell us what we're doing wrong, so thank you.\nOliver: It's great.\nTalia: I've never done wrong anything.\nAlan: That is true. Sorry, I didn't mean to slander you as such, Talia.\nOliver: Talia has never wrong done anything--\nTalia: --ever in my life.\nAlice: We know this and we love you.\nTalia: I have never wrong done anything ever.\nAlan: Hello. I'm Alan. My pronouns are he/him and I am playing Cody whose pronouns are also he/him. I live in Nashville, Tennessee, and, uh, this is my first time ever playing Dungeons and Dragons or any role playing game. And I'm very nervous, but my friends have been very helpful and I am loving it so far. And I'm very happy to be here.\nTalia: Madatory dungeon baby.\nAlice: You are doing amazing, actually.\nOliver: You can find us on Twitter (@dicedisasters) and we have more information about the show and the cast at dicedisasters.com. We are a new podcast, so if you like the show, please leave us a five star review on iTunes or wherever you're listening. That will help us reach more people and would mean the world to us.\nOliver: We've recorded a bunch of episodes in advance before they come out, but after that, we're going to be following the tradition of naming NPCs after listeners. So if you leave us a review or tweet about the show then we might name a character after you. Just tag @dicedisasters or #dicedisasters.\nAlice: And if you don't leave reviews of the show, every new NPC is going to be called Craigory and it'll be very confusing for everyone involved. So please do it.\nAlan: I love the idea of starting a podcast with a threat. Like, you will be fans or else?\nTalia: Listen, motherfuckers--\nOliver: Listen. Only you can save this podcast. Please leave a review.\nAlice: From the scourge of the Craigories!\nOliver: Or you will face the scourge of the Craigories.\n=== END MIDROLL ===\nTalia: Okay. Yeah. Uh, let's get to that new fun door.\nOliver: Okay. Great. So the four of you go through this door. Same thing, it\u2019s a little room, it's a little air lock thing. You go in, the door behind you closes, and the one in front of you opens. This time you are in another long hallway. At the opposite end is another airlock door. What do you do?\nAlan: After we all get in the room, all of a sudden from behind the group, there's just a huge, bright light that appears. Cody is totally dug into his menu and has pressed \u201clight.\u201d\nOliver: Great, cool. His hand is glowing.\nMAX: Whoa--\nCODY: Guys! Look, my hand is glowing!\nAlan: And he starts waving it around, getting it in their faces.\nZAN: That's great. We\u2019ve got a new fun flashlight person.\nOliver:  To be fair, you didn't have a flashlight before, so.\nTalia: This is true.\nZAN: Ah, I'm not going first this time. Also, I advise whoever does go first to jump off of the pressure plate rather than duck.\nRobot: Max is gonna all of a sudden remember that he's still holding this fucking wrench in his other hand, and he's gonna be like--\nMAX: Oh, wait. I got this.\nRobot: And he's just gonna throw the wrench into the room.\nOliver: Okay, Great. So it\u2019s this like, long hallway, and Max just hucks the wrench down the hallway.\nRobot: Uh huh.\nOliver: It hits the ground, cling, clang, cling, clang, and kind of like topples down and it lands on a tile and you watch the tile clicks down -- and there's a solid full second, and then fire shoots out of the wall adjacent to the tile, blasts the wrench for a second and then stops.\nZAN: Wow. Glad you hit that tile.\nMAX: Wow. I didn't expect that to work.\nJASMIN: I take it back, I want to be incentivized.\nRobot: Max is going to try to pick up the wrench and not step on that tile.\nOliver: Okay. You get a little ways down the hallway and the tile, you step on, clicks into the floor. What do you do?\nRobot: Oh, shit.\nOliver: I\u2019ll give you a reaction.\nRobot: Ah, I'm gonna go backwards.\nOliver: Okay, So do it. Give me a dexterity role to jump backwards.\nRobot: Ah, 11.\nOliver: 11. Okay, Yeah. You stumble backwards out of the way as another burst of flames just sears across the tile where you were standing. Um, you managed to get completely out of the way. You're unscathed. The fire goes for about a second and then stops.\nAlice: Do the tiles that activated the traps have anything in common? Is there a pattern that I can detect?\nOliver: Why don't you do a perception check?\nAlice: All right. Um, that would be, um, eight plus four, 12.\nOliver: Okay. Yeah. With a 12. You don't see anything on the floor, but when you look at the wall next to the tile where Max just stepped, there's these little holes that kind of like dot along that tile up the middle, and you're guessing that's where the fire came out of. The other tiles around you, like, at your end of the hallway don't have those.\nJASMIN: Um, I-- I think I figured it out. There's-- here, look.\nAlice: Jasmin points to the holes in the wall.\nJASMIN: I think if we just hop over the parts next to these, we will probably not get burnt.\nZAN: Oh, good catch. I was definitely not looking at the wall side of things. I was looking more at the floor. So, uh, guess we move forward and uh, look out for holes.\nAlan: How far away is the tile where the wrench landed?\nOliver: Um, I'd say it's like 40 feet okay. It's a long hallway. Can you throw something 40 feet?\nRobot: Yeah. Absolutely.\nOliver: Oh yeah, you were a muscle boy. Stronk. Yeah, you did it. Good job.\nRobot: Once you point that out, Max is still gonna be up front, moving forward, looking out for the holes in the wall.\nOliver: Yeah, I'm going to say that now that you know there's holes in the wall, it's going to be a pretty low dexterity check if you want to, like, walk down the hallway and just jump over each of those. So do you want to do that?\nRobot: Yeah. And I definitely want my wrench back because it was very useful.\nOliver: It was. Okay. So why don't you roll a dexterity check to, like, go down the hallway and I'll combine it with you could snag your wrench on the way by.\nRobot: That is a 10.\nOliver: [Worried noise.] A ten?\nRobot: I\u2019ve got a plus zero!\nAlice: We're level one.\nRobot: There's a lot of muscle! I can't move it very quickly!\nOliver: Okay, so you see that as Max is kind of like leaping down this hallway over every tile that is marked by these little holes, he just flubs one. Lands right in the middle of the tile. It clicks down. But I'm going to say that since you already know what happens, you just then jump off of the tile and you're okay because there is, like, a good, full like beat of you step on the tile, it clicks down. Wait. And then the things come out. So with a 10 you make it. But I imagine everyone at the end of the hallway is going: \u201cAH, OOH-- AAH!\u201d\nAlan: While he's doing that, can Cody have started to slowly make his way down the hall? Maybe get about 10 feet by the time this happened?\nJASMIN: Wait--\nOliver: Yes.\nJASMIN: Wait, Cody!\nOliver: Okay, so Cody's doing this. I'm actually, since you said you're gonna go really slow and, like, carefully jump over, I'll give you advantage if you want to roll-- I guess it's acrobatics, not dexterity. I don't know if that would have helped you.\nAlan: Uh, yes. Okay. Good. Good for advantage. That was a three. That was a 16.\nOliver: Okay. Yeah. Cody's totally fine. Cody jumps down the hallway.\nAlan: And then Well, once I get ahead little bit -- the whole time he's doing it slowly, but he's still playing with this toy on his wrist -- and he clicks the second option, and a, uh, spectral hand flies out, grabs the wrench and flies back to Cody.\nCODY: AW you won\u2019t believe what the second one does!\n[Laughter]\nOliver: So uh, Max just had the wrench ripped out of his hands by a spectral white glove like the one from Super Smash Brothers.\nRobot: Max is just sitting there, on the other side of the the hallway, slightly singed, like looking torn apart.\nRobot: What the fuck, man?\nOliver: That was his cool wrench!\nTalia: That wrench was the only cool thing that came out of this.\nMAX: My wrench!\nCODY: Sorry!\nAlice: It was wrenched away from you.\nTalia: Oh ho ho. Really throwing a wrench in your plans.\nOliver: Cody and Max are at the other end-- GOD DAMN IT\nAlan: and Cody does hand the wrench back. He did not know when he pressed that button that that exactly was going to happen.\nOliver: Perfect. All right, Max and Cody, or having a beautiful moment with the wrench at the other end of the hallway. What are my ladies gonna do?\n{47:49}\nTalia: All right. As a counter point to that beautiful moment, Zan waits until they're all the way down at the other end of the hall and then says,\nZAN: Hey, watch this!\nTalia: and runs down the hallway really fast so that she, like, can't stop on any of the plates.\nOliver: That's actually really smart. Although you're running very fast, so I'm probably not gonna give you advantage, but just roll in acrobatics check.\nTalia: Okay. [Rolls] I don't know why I keep rolling nines.\nOliver: uh oh.\nTalia: Hold on, let me check. Yeah, I have a plus zero to acrobatics. So.\nOliver: All right. So, solid nine.\nTalia: Yeah, it's a solid nine. Again.\nOliver: You watch as Zan, again, yells \u201cHey, watch this!\u201d, takes off running down the hallway and she gets, like, three quarters of the way there, before she steps on a tile that clicks into the floor. And as she easily continues running, her foot catches on the little lip that is left because it moved down, and she just tumbles forward and lands right on a tile that clicks into the ground. And I'm gonna say you're prone now, so you don't have a reaction, and Zan gets blasted with fire.\nTalia: Ah, Zan yells--\nZAN: FUCK! OH, SHOOT! NO! SHOOT! DON\u2019T!\nAlan: Can we react at all?\nOliver: I\u2019m gonna say no. The only reaction I\u2019m gonna give you is: are you watching or do you look away?\nAlice: I freeze. Want to look away, but I can\u2019t.\nOliver: Okay, great. Max, I assume-- what do you do?\nRobot: Yeah, I'm watching.\nOliver: You're watching. Cody? Do you cover your eyes or are you gonna watch this too?\nAlan: Cody cares and wants to watch, but he just can't. And so he kind of, like, has hands up. But like the fingers splayed like he's hoping that he would get like half the effect.\nOliver: Great. You're all sickos. Awesome. But conveniently, what you do see is the fire that rushes out of the wall curls around Zan\u2019s body. And Max and Jasmin, you watched Cody give off the same weird coloured light, that just blast out of her for a second and then sucks back in, and with it all of the fire gets sucked right into Zan\u2019s body. And she is laying there and looks completely unharmed. Although her hands, I guess they're exposed, and you can kind of see they\u2019re flickering a little bit. They\u2019ve got a kind of a reddish orangeish light.\nZAN: I'm okay! I think.\nJASMIN: Are you sure?? You look like you might have radiation poisoning!\nZAN: I'm mean, like, maybe, but it\u2019s--\nINTERCOM: BING BONG. Congratulations. Your exposure to the sympathetic parallel energy has manifested into abilities congruent with the RANGER designation. You may now access the main menu of your sympathetic parallel energy liaison. Touch your proprietary SPEL prototype wristbands together to access the main menu.\nZAN: The heck is a Ranger?\nMAX: Isn\u2019t that like a military thing?\nCODY: Like the Power Rangers??\nMAX: Ah, hell, yeah! Power Rangers!\nZAN: Literally. All I can think of is that bit over a stove.\nJASMIN: Ah, you-- you take care of forests?\nZAN: Okay\u2026\nJASMIN: That's what a ranger does, right?\nZAN: Great. I'm Smokey the Bear. Let's keep going.\nINTERCOM: BING BONG. This test has been completed. Please proceed to testing chamber E.\nZAN: Hey, Jasmin, you should run through too. Pretty sure it won't do the fire anymore. Probably.\nJASMIN: I am not very good at running. Um\u2026\nRobot: Max is gonna go to the last tile that he knows-- and, ah, like from off the tile with his foot, push it down and then back up.\nOliver: Okay, Great. Yeah, You do that. The tile clicks down, but no fire comes out. It looks like the voice was was not lying.\nCody: The moment Cody sees that it's not working. Cody's gonna run to Jasmin and then having seen shield on his wrist, press the button and and hope it puts a shield up and walk with Jasmin down the hallway.\nOliver: Okay, cool. So when Cody presses the button for shield, a big bubble just appears around him, and it's shimmering and beautiful. He's in a little bubble now. Cody, you see that another check gets filled in, so you have two filled check boxes next to level one spells.\nAlan: Oh...  was feather fall the first one that was cast, that I didn't know about?\nOliver: Yeah.\nAlan: Okay. Makes sense.\nAlice: Jasmin grabs ahold of Cody's hand and follows very closely.\nOliver: Okay, great. You two make it down to the other end. You're totally fine.\nZAN: Hey, kid. Are you a good wizard or a bad wizard?\nCODY: Um... I As in school?\nZAN: That's... awesome. You're a kid, and you probably have never seen that movie. Let's keep going.\nOliver: Great. The shield around Cody dissipates by the time you guys pile into the airlock again and then you get to see testing chamber E. This next room is another large square with the door on the opposite wall, and in the middle is a trench of water. It's about 20 feet across. Looks like the pit room. But this time it's water. What do you do?\nRobot: Uh, Max is gonna, like saunter over to Zan and like, very quietly and trying to be not obvious, but being very obvious, whisper--\nMAX: Does\u2026 that mean he was a good wizard or a bad wizard?\nZAN: I think maybe good at Wizard, but morally unsure? I don't know. Why don't you ask him?\nMAX: But what if he\u2019s a bad wizard?\nZAN: He\u2019s like, 12 dude.\nMAX: Yeah, you're right. I could probably take him.\nTalia: As they walk into the room, Zan taps her bracelets together to check out her stats.\nOliver: Okay, Cool. Zan, You see options like Ethereal Longbow, Ethereal Short Sword, and then a list of spells: absorb elements, jump, and cure wounds. You also see that one has been checked off already. And you as a person, can just guess which one, or you could do an intelligence check and I'll tell you if you know which one it was.\nTalia: I'm gonna figure out that it's absorb elements.\nOliver: Nice. That role playing.\nTalia: I\u2019m a smart cookie.\nOliver: Just from context.\nAlice: Jasmin, after basically getting guided through the last few rooms, looks at this 12 year old child that helped her through the last room, takes a very deep breath and says,\nJASMIN: Okay, water I can do! It's just water.\nZAN: Probably.\nJASMIN: I'll just swim across.\nAlice: And is going to very cautiously walk over to the edge of the water and look in.\nOliver: And look in it. Okay. Make a perception check.\nAlice: Perception\u2019s all I roll bay-be.\nOliver: Jasmin\u2019s good at looking at stuff.\nAlice: That's a five plus four, nine.\nOliver: It's, um, blue. And yep, that's some water. That's blue.\nAlice: Okay.\nOliver: It's like, dark blue.\nAlice: I'm gonna get in it.\nOliver: All right, you get in it. Jasmin just carefully lowers herself into the water. It's like, warmish water. It\u2019s pretty nice, actually. And you do notice that once you're in it, that it is murky, cloudy. Like as you move your arms around you can see your arms a little bit, but you, like, can't see your own feet kind of thing.\nAlice: Can I touch the floor?\nOliver: No. You reach your legs down, you can't feel a bottom.\nAlice: Okay? The rest of you, probably hear... Jasmin kind of hyperventilate a little bit, but she starts swimming forward.\nOliver: [Nervous noise] Okay--\nTalia: I think we're all just watching, like, fists clenched.\nOliver: So you watched Jasmin-- is Jasmin a good swimmer?\nAlice: Not great, but good enough. Like, she did all of the like, mandatory swimming lessons. And then, when it came to the non mandatory swimming lessons, she was like, \u201cnope!\u201d\nOliver: Love that. Love also that she's from a place that has mandatory swimming lessons. We'll learn more about that later, I assume. So. You're watching as Jasmin's kind of making her way across the water. The water is not like, wavy or anything, so it's It's pretty easy. She\u2019s kind of half dog paddling, just kind of propelling herself across. And Jasmin, you feel something close around your leg. Uh, just below the knee. And then you are ripped under the water.\nAlice: Oh, fuck.\nOliver: And I'm many say to keep track of timing... let's roll initiative!\nRobot: Oh, no.\nTalia: Great. Come on. No. Nine.\nRobot: All of us?\nOliver: Yeah, well, unless you want to just not do anything... but assume you'll want to do something.\nAlice: You want to watch me die??\nTalia: That 17 for the role that doesn't matter as much if you get a big number.\nOliver: Okay, 17.\nAlice: I get a nine. That\u2019s a 10 minus one.\nTalia: Another nine.\nAlan: Also 17.\nTalia: Hey, twinsies.\nOliver: 17. What was Max\u2019s?\nRobot: Uh, nine. So many nines.\nOliver: What?? Now you gotta all tell me your DEX modifiers. Jasmin, what's your modifier?\nJasmin: Mine is minus 1.\nCody: I\u2019m at zero.\nTalia: Oh, I have no dex modifier. Oh, sorry. I had negative two initiative. So that's a 15.\nOliver: Okay, great. That has solved my problem.\nAlice: Um, so I think the moment that, uh, Jasmin feels that thing clamp onto her knee and she gets tracked down, you just hear, like a high pitched squeal and then flailing arms, she gets dragged into the water.\nTalia: High pitched burbling.\nOliver: SoJasmin is solidly under the water, and Cody you\u2019re up first.\nAlan: Cody looks down quickly at his wrist thing and just opens it up, and hits Mage Hand, to try to reach out and grab Jasmin and hopefully, like, pull her up.\nOliver: Okay, so you press Mage Hand. This, like, spectral gloved hand appears, plunges into the water. Um, you can't see where it's going. But, Cody, you just feel that this hand has grabbed onto Jasmin's arm, and it gives a solid pull... but does not have any effect, like it is not strong enough to make any difference on pulling her out of the water. That was a good try, though. And then is Zan\u2019's turn.\nTalia: [Groans.]\nOliver: You're all welcome to just say your character does nothing for their turn.\nTalia: I mean, that seems like kind of a dick move. But I also don't see how anything I have would be particularly helpful.\nAlice: You could also just respond to the situation by like, \u201cOh, fuck,\u201d\nTalia: Just be like, \u201cHey, you good?\u201d\nZAN: Hey, you okay? Need help?\nRobot: You're sitting on the side, being like \u201cHey, fam, you all right?\u201d\nOliver: \u201cYou all right down there?\u201d\nOliver: Okay, So why don't we say that if you're just going to kind of like, look down and inquire as to whether she's okay, um, why don't you roll a perception check?\nTalia: All right, I can do that. That's a five.\nOliver: Yeah uhh... The water is kind of sloshing a little bit.\nZAN: Ah...\nOliver: You know Jasmin's in there, and that's bad.\nZAN: Hey, guys, I found a big pit of water.\nOliver: Ah, it is Jasmin's turn next.\nAlice: Okay. Uh, I am underwater.\nOliver: Yes.\nAlice: Something's bitten my leg--\nOliver: Something is holding onto your leg.\nAlice: Something's holding onto my leg. It doesn't hurt?\nOliver: It hurts a little bit. I'm actually going to say you take one point of damage.\nAlice: All right. Uh, do I see anything around me? In the water?\nOliver: Yeah. So you you have your eyes open, you look down and you can see this, like, large shape. Some\u2026 \u201cthing\u201d has grabbed onto your leg. It's about maybe, like, six feet long.\nAlice: What is it shaped like?\nOliver: Um, like a shark.\nAlice: Oh, fun!\nTalia: Like a shark with arms.\nOliver: Like a shark.\nAlan: One of those fun sharks.\nOliver: Yeah.\nAlice: Can I try and punch it on the nose?\nOliver: Yeah, totally.\nAlice: I remember, from TV!\nOliver: All right, go ahead and roll a D20, and your unarmed strike is a minus one to hit. So\u2026\nAlice: Yes, also, it's underwater, which probably doesn't help. That's an 11 minus one.\nOliver: No, but I'll give you that you managed to, like, push your arm down to try to hit it in the nose, and your fist connects, and you hit metal. And then just kind of your fist bounces right off.\nAlice: Okay, so that didn't help. I still have movement. Is it at all possible for me to try and get some air?\nOliver: No, you are grappled.\nAlice: Okay.\nOliver: So you are trapped by this shark. Yeah. You can see that the surface of the water is maybe, like, six feet above you. So you're not super deep, but you are underwater.\nAlice: Okay, then I\u2019m just gonna flail.\nOliver: All right, yeah. And then Jasmin uses her movement to flail. Max, what are you going to do?\nRobot: Uh, you said the water's murky. So, like, just at a very quick glance, I cannot see any part of Jasmin?\nOliver: I'm going to say you can see a darker shape, so you can see the general vicinity. You don't know what's going on. But you see that there is something in the water, like on the like, left side of the trough, kind of like pit of water, close to your side.\nRobot: All right. Ah, I'm going in head first.\nOliver: Oh, shit! All right, you guys watch as Max just jumps straight in the water. I'm going to say that you can get pretty close to them, touching to them if you want to use your movement to get down there because I said they were only like six feet under water. So, even 1/2 movement should get you there. It's hard for you to see what's going on, but you get the gist. Jasmin, is there; a big metal thing is biting her leg.\nRobot: Ah, I'm just gonna grab Jasmin and try to swim out.\nOliver: Okay, great. Okay, So you grab Jasmin, let's see, grab onto both of her arms and start kicking to push upwards. Um, why don't you make a strength check?\nRobot: Oh, boy. Ah, Strength is... Ah, 11.\nOliver: 11. Okay, nope, the metal shark got 17.\nRobot: Yikes.\nOliver: So you give a solid pull to try to rip Jasmin out of its jaws. Um, but you both end up getting dragged a little bit deeper by the shark. And I'm going to say that in that moment, Max, you're holding onto Jasmin's arms and you've realized that the two of you are going down deeper, like you are not strong enough to pull her back out. And you watch from like, two feet away from her face, as her eyes just glow with this brilliant, swirling pink, yellow, purple light and it pulses out of her body and the two of you-- you and the shark-- both need to make a dexterity saving throw.\nRobot: Oh, boy, It's my specialty.\nOliver: Woof!\nRobot: That's Ah, three,\nOliver: Three. Great. That's all right, the shark got a five. Um, Jasmin can you roll two D8 for me?\nAlice: Sure. Uh, 3 and a 2, 5.\nOliver: Five. All right, Max, you take five points of damage and you are blasted back out of the pool. You like-- you're up on the surface and you slam your back into the edge of the the tiles that are surrounding this water. You can breathe again. The shark is blasted off of Jasmin's foot. And I'm going to say that with that push, Jasmin bobs back up to the surface. And it is Cody's turn. You you can now see Max and Jasmin.\nAlan: Okay? Cody peeks out from behind Zan where he where he went with things-- actually, when Max jumped in, got scared enough about what was going on, that he hid behind Zan.\nZAN: What, it\u2019s just water. I don\u2019t see anything.\nAlan: Can Cody see the thing in the water now with the blast?\nOliver: No. It was blasted down. Max is now at the surface. Jasmin's of the surface.\nAlan: Okay.\nOliver: Probably both gasping for air.\nAlice: Jasmin looks extremely scared. Is there like, blood in the water around me?\nOliver: No. I'm going to say that it clamped onto your leg but didn't draw blood.\nAlan: Okay, uh, Cody is not going to jump in. He just saw stuff go crazy.\nOliver: That went bad.\nAlan: Crazy. Uh, he's also he knows he's small child. Like if Max couldn't do nothing. No matter. PE is gonna help Cody. Cody runs over to Max, puts his hand on Max's jumpsuit and presses the light button.\nOliver: All right. Max. Max. Max, your jumpsuit is now fuckin glowing.\nTalia: Rad.\nRobot: Sick.\nOliver: Max coughs up some water. \u201cGuh-- Sick.\u201d\nMAX: Aw, this is like... that rave last month.\nOliver: Okay, now it's now it's Zan\u2019s turn. Just to recap. Jasmin's probably about in the middle treading water. Looks like she's gonna cry. Max is wearing a glowing jumpsuit. You think Cody did that.\nTalia: Uh, where's the shark? Can I see it?\nOliver: No, you actually-- you wouldn't even know that there is a shark.\nTalia: This is true\u2026\nOliver: Yes, but you don't see anything else in the water.\nTalia: Okay\u2026\nAlan: With the light being cast off the jumpsuit, is it illuminating anything in the water?\nOliver: Yeah, I would say a good couple feet around, Max, you can now see that the water is empty.\nTalia: I think that sort of instinct is gonna be that Zan is just gonna, like, try to get Jasmin out there. She sees that she's really scared, and so she's gonna, like, probably just jump in. Yeah, and like, go try and help out.\nOliver: OKAY!\nTalia: I don\u2019t know there\u2019s a shark!\nOliver: Okay. let's see... Yeah, I think you just thought she was really bad at swimming.\nTalia: I mean, maybe?? I don't know, cramps happen.\nAlice: It would probably jive with your impression of her so far.\nTalia: Yeah I dunno, did you like eat something? In the last hallway?\nOliver: I think your movements, like, 30 feet, and Jasmin is 20 feet away. Okay, so yeah, I'll say if you jump in, swim over to Jasmin, you can swim with her to the other side of the pool.\nTalia: Okay, nice.\nOliver: So, yeah. So now the two of you are on the other end.\nZAN: I don't know why y\u2019all thought this was so hard. Just gotta swim across\nJASMIN: Sh-shark! Shark! There\u2019s a shark!\nZAN: Sure--\nCODY: Hey, be careful!\nJASMIN: There\u2019s a metal shark!\nOliver: Okay, Zan, yeah, now you and Jasmin are still in the water at the other end of the pool, but, uh, you' now know there\u2019s a shark in there. It's Jasmin's turn. What do you do? You made it to the other side.\nAlice: Can I climb up the other side?\nOliver: Yes. You climb right the fuck up outta that pool.\nAlice: Zan is still in it. Can I try and get her out?\nOliver: Um, yeah. Why don't you do a strength check just to see if you fail miserably,\nAlice: Okay.\nOliver: It\u2019s not against her will so it\u2019s gonna be a pretty low one.\nTalia: No, I actually want to stay in here with the shark.\nOliver: It's nice and warm.\nAlice: [Rolls.] Oh, wow. Oh, wow. I am really bad at strength, but I rolled a 19.\nOliver: Oh hell yeah.\nAlice: I have 8 strength, so that is, um, 18.\nOliver: Just like, pumping with adrenaline and fear, Jasmin reaches down with her two scrawny little arms and rips Zan right out of that pool. You are no longer in the pool. You are both on the edge and it is Max's turn.\nZAN: Can I just say I'm really glad we're both out of there, and across here. I kind of wish I\u2019d known there was a shark in there before I jumped in.\nJASMIN: I\u2019m sorry.\nRobot: So, Max and Cody on the opposite side.\nOliver: Yeah, you're still on the wrong side of it.\nRobot: And I'm still in the water.\nOliver: Yeah.\nRobot: And Cody's next to me.\nOliver: YOU know there's a shark.\nRobot: Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna climb out of the water. On the wrong side.\nOliver: Good choice. Okay. Max has made a very good decision, in my opinion, looking at the initiative order and seeing that the shark is next. So Max climbs out of the water and, uh, I'm gonna say all of that round happened in six seconds, like combat is supposed to do in dungeons and dragons. And you are now out of initiative because you're out of the water and you hear that chime.\nINTERCOM: BING BONG. Congratulations. Your exposure to the sympathetic parallel energy has manifested into abilities congruent with the DRUID designation. You may now access the main menu of your sympathetic parallel energy liaison. Touch your proprietary SPEL prototype wristbands together to access the main menu.\nJASMIN: Oh great, I'm an old bearded pagan man.\nZAN: I mean, you could be like a hot one like-- like Merlin in that show. That probably wasn't helpful.\nINTERCOM: BING BONG. This test is now complete. Please proceed to testing chamber F.\nOliver: And with that, you hear a gurgling noise. GLURG GLURG GLURG GLURG. And the water level lowers. But before it gets too low, a set of tiles making up the walls start to just kind of like, click clack click clack, fold out until it is a smooth, flat surface which you could easily walk across.\nAlice: I will get up and try to help Zan up and then tap the things together.\nOliver: You tap them together and you can see things like Equip Ethereal Short Sword, Equip Ethereal Root Shield. And then a bunch of spells, like shape water, gust, produce flame, detect magic, jump, and thunder wave. And just like the two other people who have their powers manifested, you have one of your two check boxes already filled.\nAlice: Uh huh. Cause I cast thunder wave on my friend.\nOliver: At this point, I want to ask, have any of your characters played Dungeons and Dragons?\nEveryone: No.\nTalia: I think Zan plays like a lot of video games, but not dungeons and dragons.\nOliver: All right. Great. No reason.\n[Laughter.]\nAlan: Cody runs over to Jasmin.\nCODY: Are-- are you okay? Uh, I tried to help. I tried! Um, are you okay?\nJASMIN: Um, yeah. Oh... It's not your fault. Uh, oh there was a shark. It was like metal, but it was a shark.\nTalia: Zan sort of pat's Jasmin on the shoulder awkwardly and says,\nZAN: Hey, uh, well, it's over. That part. Though,\nJASMIN: Right. Um right. Yeah.\nRobot: Uh, Max is laying on the floor like 20 feet away, fucking soaking wet with the wind knocked out of him. Just like playing with the light up jumpsuit and softly, softly fist pumping, going [bassy techno music noises].\n[Laughter.]\nOliver: That was not what I was expecting.\nAlan: Cody leans into Jasmin is like,\nCODY: Hey, uh, did you see I made him glow?\nJASMIN: Yeah. That's really cool. I think I can... I think I can do something like that too, uh, wait\u2026\nAlice: And Jasmin looks at her menu, sees that her option includes fire. And goes like--\nJASMIN: Nevermind.\nTalia: Zan looks over Jasmin\u2019s shoulder and looks it shape water and goes--\nZAN: Wow. I wish we'd gotten you activated in like, the last one, huh?\nJASMIN: Yeah, I guess that would have been nice.\nZAN: Might have been more helpful than jump.\nJASMIN: I mean, you could have jumped across, maybe?\nZAN: No, no no-- I can make someone else jump good.\nJASMIN: I mean, you can touch yourself, right?\nZAN: I guess... The problem is, I don't know how far I could jump, so I don't know whether tripling it would have done anything.\nAlan: Cody walks over to Max and with the complete not understanding what's appropriate just goes--\nCODY: Hey, uh, we all have powers. What about you?\n[Laughter.]\nMAX: Uhhh\u2026.\nRobot: Max is gonna like tap his risk together. And is like,\nMAX: No, Still, no.\nZAN: Well, we'll make sure to get you bludgeoned in the next chamber. And maybe that will awaken something in you. Hopefully something magical.\nJASMIN: You have the wrench power?\nMAX: Yeah, I still have my wrench.\nCODY: I hope you're an earth bender.\nOliver: Great. And you hear the chime--\nINTERCOM: BING BONG. Please proceed to testing chamber F.\nZAN: I really hope there isn't a whole alphabet of these.\nJASMIN: Yeah, I would prefer not to see testing chamber zed.\nZAN: That would suck.\nMAX: Hold on, that would only be like.. [fumbles through numbers] UH 20? 20 Um, twenty\u2026 two? More? right?\nZAN: I don't remember what room we're in.\nJASMIN: Well, the next one's F, so\u2026\nZAN: That's a good point.\nMAX: So was I right or--\nZAN: Oh, I don't know.\nINTERCOM: BING BONG. Please proceed to testing chamber F. If you do not proceed to the next testing chamber F, you will be incentivized to do so.\nJASMIN: Let's go.\nZAN: I thought you wanted to see what the incentive was like.\nJASMIN: No, no, it's mean-- maybe it's more sharks!\n[Laughter.]\nOliver: It just starts raining sharks from the ceiling.\nJASMIN: Maybe the incentive in sharks, and I don't want more sharks.\nZAN: Or maybe it's like a good dental program. You don't know that.\nJASMIN: That sounds worse!\nZAN: I'm kidding. Let's go into--\nOliver: You hear a rumbling noise. Similar to the noise that happened when the pit rose up with Cody on it. And you watch as the walls on either side start closing in.\nCODY: This is like that old movie. You know. Star Wars! Y\u2019all have seen it, right?\nZAN: Yeah. Let's-- we can talk about Star Wars all you like later kid.\nTalia: Were sprinting towards the door. Zan grabs whoever's closest to her and just, like, runs.\nOliver: Just shoves them through the door, great. You enter into that little airlock space, and this time, when you go in there, the door behind you closes, changes to red. But one in front of you, doesn\u2019t. And as you stand there in this little space, the weight of these trials catches up with you. You feel tired. Jasmin, your leg where you got bit is throbbing. Max, when you look at him, is not doing very well at all. He's kind of like clutching one side of his ribs. Jasmin, you hear a faint hissing noise.\n[Hissing noise]\nOliver: All of you, your eyelids are feeling heavy. You're wet. You\u2019re tired. And one by one, you kind of sit down. Just a rest for a moment. What do you do?\nAlice: What I at all be-- Do I need to roll something to figure out what that is? Or could I intuit that somehow? You think I'm smart enough?\nOliver: I think you can just guess. Or you can roll an investigation check to try to find out what it's like, and I can tell you something specific about it.\nAlice: Okay. I, Alice, have a pretty good guess. That's why, um, but, uh, see. That's a 15 plus 2, 17.\nOliver: Okay, So with that, you can see that there are little holes on one of the tiles above you on the ceiling, and through it, you can see this, like, shimmering haze of air being pushed into this little six-by-six airlock space that you're in.\nOliver: That's all you have time for. After you register that there's some gas coming in. I assume you haven't said anything.
